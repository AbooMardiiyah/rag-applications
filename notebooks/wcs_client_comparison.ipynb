But today I really want to concentrate not on the things that modulate our overall health, but rather the things that mediate brain health directly. And in particular, how certain foods enhance brain function. And we are going to talk about how we can change our relationship to food, literally how we can start to prefer certain foods that are better for us than others. So just briefly, I want to touch on the modulatory components because they are vital. First of all, getting quality sleep on a regular basis and ample sleep on a regular basis is the foundation of all mental health and physical health. There's no question about that.

There's simply no tool that's going to allow you to overcome chronic sleep deprivation and allow you to remain focused. No pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever. There are tools to overcome one night or maybe two nights of sleep deprivation, and we'll talk about those. But at a fundamental level, we need to do the things that modulate our focus and attention in powerful ways, and sleep really is that thing. So we've done two episodes, one called Master Your Sleep, and the other episode is Perfect Your Sleep. The Perfect Your Sleep is a little bit more like this episode, more focused on protocols. Master Your Sleep includes protocols and mechanism. Again, you can find those at hubermanlab.com. We also have a sleep toolkit, a distilled list of things to do in order to optimize your sleep.

And of course, in doing so, the quality of your daytime alertness and your ability to focus will improve tremendously.

So if there's one area of your life to really focus on and try and optimize, if your goal is to be happier and more productive and just to have a better life overall, I can confidently say that sleep is really the thing to optimize.

And indeed there are data linking poor quality sleep to dementia, or at least exacerbating preexisting dementias and things of that sort. So get your sleep in order. The other of course is cardiovascular health and exercise. The general prescription that's out there in the literature and I think is well supported is to get somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week. If you choose to also use resistance exercise, that's great, but the 150 to 180 minutes minimum per week of cardiovascular exercise is crucial for heart health and heart health directly relates to brain health because the brain consumes a lot of oxygen, glucose, and other factors that are delivered via the blood.

Absolutely outsized effects on mood and focus during the day and quality of sleep at night.

That means you still need to do some of the other things that we're going to talk about in terms of directed approaches at improving mood and mental health. If you are to quote unquote optimize your mood and mental health, or if you are, let's just say, trying to constantly improve your mood and mental health.

In the episode on focus, I cited a number of studies where this has actually been tested and deployed in various schools, having kids do a focus task where they look at a particular visual target for 30 to 60 seconds, then doing some mathematics and seeing pretty impressive improvement in focus and attention, even in people that have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and so on.\"}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Huberman_minilm_256'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('e6d3223a-54a1-4e3a-ad4e-25df63bab48b'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=0.3949935734272003, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'content': \"I would never want anyone to try and use NSDR as a total replacement for sleep, but under conditions in which you cannot control your sleep, NSDR is going to be the best way that I am aware of to restore your ability to focus and concentrate for whatever purpose.

And as the diaphragm moves up, the heart has less space, meaning it gets a little bit smaller, which means that whatever volume of blood is inside the heart moves faster through that smaller volume.

You inhale air and that air and the oxygen molecules in that air actually move from your lungs into the bloodstream because these little alveoli of the lungs, those little sacks of air, they basically have a lot of little micro vessels and capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although they're mostly capillaries, micro capillaries are the little tiny ones that line them.

Just to drill in how incredible that really is a little bit further, if you see a beautiful painting or the picture or presence of somebody's face in real life that evokes a particularly strong positive or negative emotion, you can imagine that of course it creates the release of certain neurochemicals or perhaps in the case of a negative face, suppresses the release of certain neurochemicals.\"}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Huberman_minilm_256'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('46a00ceb-504e-4fc9-bcc2-afdd7ec06ec7'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=0.5421007871627808, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'content': \"The title of this meta-analysis is Effects of Music on the Cardiovascular System, and it was published in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine.

Now this makes perfect sense in light of the model they propose, which is this self-regulation model that basically self-regulation involves several things. It involves engaging in certain behaviors and suppressing other behaviors. So as described before, because alcohol tends to have a sedative suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system, at least after the initial period, it's going to tend to reduce the likelihood that people will engage in any type of behavior, whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal and increase the likelihood that someone will engage in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise.

I don't think I mentioned this, and I want to make sure that I mentioned that breathing, controlling heart rate through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is the basis of what's called HRV, heart rate variability.

Our colleague, David Spiegel, our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford, and also a colleague of yours as well, has, I think, said it best, which is that breathing is unique among the functions of the brain because it really originates as a brain function and then extends, of course, to the body in that it represents a bridge between the conscious and the unconscious. Because at any given moment we're breathing. And of course, at any given moment, we can take control of our breathing. There are very few brain circuits that impact the body in that way.

This is an extremely powerful set of techniques that we know from scientific studies that are being done in my lab, Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA and others now that are very, very useful for reducing your stress response in real time. And here's how they work. These days, there seems to be a lot of interest in breath work. Breath work typically is when you go and you sit down or you lie down and you deliberately breathe in a particular way for a series of minutes in order to shift your physiology, access some states.

That is to bring them down, which has outsized positive effects on your mood and mental health, not just in the moment, but it also should improve your confidence that when stress comes, because the world is filled with stressors, it's not if, it's when, when stress comes that you will have a physiologically, scientifically supported tool to deal with and reduce that stress.

So I love the Brock's breathing tool post-workout, and there's some other alternatives there too that i just mentioned but i think people greatly underestimate the potency of breathing for shifting one's nervous system function away from stress or if one wants toward more alertness and stress i actually have a couple questions for you on that sure i think the audience would appreciate this uh how long were those boxes does it it just user selected? Great question. So we used the carbon dioxide tolerance test in order for people to determine how long the different sides of the box should be.

And the best way that I'm aware of that's grounded in excellent physiology and neuroscience to reduce your stress in real time is the so-called physiological sigh. I did not invent this pattern of breathing. It's not breath work per se. This is a pattern of breathing that we all naturally do in our sleep to restore carbon dioxide and oxygen levels to their proper ratios. We also do it periodically throughout the day without noticing. Indeed, we have a defined or specific neural circuit in our brain that extends to our diaphragm and communicates with aspects of our heart, et cetera, that allow physiological sighs to calm us down faster, at least to my knowledge, than any other directed protocol.

They involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat, not to the extreme, and then when we feel flooded with adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally, calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body. So unlike trying to unify the mind and body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I actually do as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological size in real time.

Now, the reason this is so attractive as a tool for controlling stress is that it works in real time. This doesn't involve a practice that you have to go and sit there and do anything separate from life. And we are going to get to emotion. Emotions and stress happen in real time. And so while it's wonderful to have a breath work practice or to have the opportunity to get a massage or sit in a sauna or do whatever it is that you do in order to set your stress controls in the right direction, having tools that you can reach to in real time that require no learning.

And you may need to repeat the physiological sigh a few times. So that's an important note about the use of breathing to control levels of stress. The other thing is that when you decide to look to the body to control the mind, it does something else that's very powerful. When you are stressed in your mind and body, so you're feeling really agitated, activated, and worried, and you use a tool like the physiological sigh or exhale emphasize breathing, you will notice that then your brain and your mind becomes more available for controlling the stress response and reacting to it, which is great because the sweet spot in life is to be, provided you're not trying to sleep, is to be alert and calm.\"}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Huberman_minilm_256')]),\n",

Or do you view stress as natural and something that's going to enhance us? And so we set out to design a series of studies to test the extent to which these mindsets about stress mattered.

Chronic stress, however, stress that lasts more than four to seven days, and there's a way to think about what chronic stress really is in an actionable way, causes changes in the feedback loop between the adrenals and the brain and the pituitary such that now the brain and the pituitary respond to high levels of glucocorticoids, cortisol, by releasing more of them.

And then of course, there are going to be dozens, if not hundreds, maybe even thousands of other variables that we're not even aware of. Perhaps it's negative ionization. Most people aren't measuring the ionization of the air when they go out into nature, but perhaps it's also the presence of certain smells from the soils that are being broken down and then they're changing the oxygenation state of the air around you, the plants, et cetera.\"}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Huberman_minilm_256'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('234e1930-7d45-4438-8742-b91391b2eaa0'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=0.6025909185409546, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'content': \"There's actually a laboratory at Columbia University School of Medicine that has published fairly extensively on the health benefits of negative ionization as it relates to setting circadian rhythm and some other aspects of mental and physical health.

There does seem to be some positive health benefits to placing oneself near bodies of water, in particular, moving bodies of water.

And the reason we call it that as opposed to something else, or simply adult plasticity, is that there are many different forms of neuroplasticity. There is, for instance, maladaptive neuroplasticity that occurs if one gets a really hard head hit and concussion, there will be changes to the brain and nervous system, but those changes to the brain and nervous system do not allow it to perform better. In fact, it often impairs the brain and nervous system's ability to function and therefore is maladaptive.

So if I say neuroplasticity or neuroplasticity, I'm referring to the same process, which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change itself.

However, I think it's fair to say that in the last 10 years, the field of neuroscience has shed light on not just the neural circuits, meaning the areas of the brain that control the fear response and the ways that it does it, but some important ways to extinguish fears using behavioral therapies, drug therapies, and what we call brain machine interfaces. Today, we are going to talk about all of those, and you are going to come away with both an understanding of the biology of fear and trauma, as well as many practical tools to confront fear and trauma.

So I wish I had one answer, but I'm going to say lots of strategies tackle that. And so in those three bins, one are top-down strategies of awareness and things that we can say to ourselves since our beliefs and mindsets can really help us release stress, view stress more positively. The second bucket is not that the mind changes the body, but the body changes the mind. And those are the set of strategies that you tend to use the most, right? We're working stress out of the body.

And this is why I say that neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change itself in response to experience, is first stimulated by attention and focus and often a low-level state of agitation. So understand that, and you won't be quite so troubled about the little stress increases that you experience throughout the day. Now, there are ways to leverage stress, epinephrine and cortisol in ways that serve you and to do it in a deliberate way. There are also ways to do that that increase your level of stress threshold, meaning they make it less likely that epinephrine and cortisol will be released.

That's why we came up with the tripartite model, because yes, we could think about just adjusting the clock with lights in and being dark throughout the day, but that may not be important for your whole physiological function. So now if we include these other effects of light, that's why I prefer to still get a lot of light in the day. I don't want to be in very dim light condition throughout the day. So even though it doesn't affect your clock, as you beautifully said, Andrew, it may affect your mood and learning and memory.

So that's why we came up with the tripartite model, because as a circadian biologist, I only thought of light through the circadian clock affecting behavior. As a sleep biologist, they only thought of the homeostatic drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. And for people who study light for vision and other things, they thought only of the environmental input. But now if you put them all together, you get with this tripartite model where it's really mind-boggling and it makes so much sense. The organism doesn't want to depend on a single component.

In other words, we shouldn't just think about the presence of light in the morning and throughout the day as positive for mental health. That's all true. It's absolutely true.

And this is very important. I think that out there these days, we hear a lot about stress reduction techniques, and most all of the stress reduction techniques that have been explored, everything from massage to meditation, to breath work, to a hot shower, to a foot rub will calm you down. The question is, do they calm you down just during that practice? Great if it does, but does it also translate to reduce levels of stress at other times in the 24 hour cycle and other positive effects as well.

Other things like MAO inhibitors, monoamine oxase inhibitors, work a different way. They inhibit the enzyme. Anytime you hear ASE in biology, it's very likely an enzyme which breaks things down. So MAO inhibitors prevent the breakdown, not the reuptake, but the breakdown of neurotransmitter and therefore allow more neurotransmitter to be available in the synapse and influence the postsynaptic cell.

Have a chemical that under certain circumstances is released in the brain that triggers the activity of neural circuits that makes the organism, you, more likely to stay in an interaction with something or even lean in and seek a more detailed interaction with that person, place, or thing.

Now, the point of the discussion we just had over the last 10 minutes or so was several fold. First of all, I do believe it's important to understand the key components of neuroplasticity, which is this remarkable feature of our brain and nervous system that we all have, right? This ability to change our own brain circuits. No other organ in the body, as far as we know, can direct its own changes, but we can direct our own brain changes. And the NMDA receptor is absolutely critical for that. I also think it's important to understand the difference between inhibitory and excitatory communication between neurons, because that's just central to understanding brain function. Brain function is a series of accelerators and brakes. It's not all about neurons stimulating other neurons. It's also about neurons preventing the activation of other neurons.\"}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Huberman_minilm_256'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('91b3edcf-c158-4305-bd5d-d84b1b4fea3d'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=0.3825123608112335, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'content': 'Now, equally important is to understand that while we do have neurotransmitters, that is the chemicals that are released between neurons, nerve cells that allow neurons to communicate, things like glutamate and GABA, for instance, and we have what are called neuromodulators.

Neuromodulators and neurotransmitters are always present in a cocktail in our brain and body. That is, they are present in different ratios and at different levels. So we need to completely discard with the idea that any one neurotransmitter or any one neuromodulator is solely responsible for a state of happiness or for a lack of state of happiness for that matter.

So that makes sense because the thought could be, well, the drive is what the drive is and it varies across people. No, there's a range the drive is in and that range can be very broad. People can do all sorts of things to cultivate the better. We all can. So if we look at it as an unlimited upside, then what we see is I want to know where are they at in me now? What's going on inside of me? What are all those other factors? Because I want to cultivate the good.

Indeed, we are going to talk about setting goals. We are also going to talk about how to assess progress towards goals, and we are going to talk about goal execution.

We're going to touch on a little bit of the psychology and how the neuroscience relates to what's known in the psychology literature.

Before we dive into our conversation about goals and goal setting and goal achievement, I'd like to highlight some recent scientific findings that I think are going to be interesting and actionable for many of you out there.

And so as we take a moment and we shift our attention to the psychology of goal setting, the things that you've probably heard a bit more about, about what sorts of goals are good and how to set goals and how to categorize goals, I want you to think about how dopamine could possibly be involved in these different processes. And the reason I want you to do this is that all of the psychology of goal setting and goal pursuit is wonderful because it places things into different categories. It allows us to parse our thinking and organize our thinking, but what's not often seen, in fact, I'm not aware of any literature out there, scientific or literature in the popular press or in popular books, is an understanding of how the underlying neurobiology can be layered on top of the psychology of goal setting to allow us to set and pursue our goals more effectively.\"}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Huberman_minilm_256'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('7dc311af-1e45-45e1-9d6f-ff90582318f9'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=0.4364895224571228, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'content': \"And that's what we're going to do today.

You're going to come away with some very specific lists of takeaways that you can put down on paper if you like, and that you can use to set goals, assess goals, and execute goals more effectively using the neuroscience of the circuits I just described and an understanding of the neuromodulator dopamine. Let's take a look at the psychology of goal setting and goal pursuit. This is an enormous literature, meaning there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of scientific papers about the topic of goal setting and goal pursuit.

As always, I really want to thank you for your time and attention. If you've learned something useful today, please pass it along. One of the things that we teach in science that I think is really wonderful to adopt in general in life is this idea of watch one, do one, teach one. This is what we tell graduate students and med students and postdocs. Watch somebody do something, learn it, then do it, apply it, see if it works for you, and then teach it.

What is that process? Well, it turns out it's a neural circuit. A neural circuit is simply a collection of brain areas that when active in a particular sequence, give rise to a particular behavior or perception. So for instance, when you feel happy, it's not because you have a brain area that's the happy brain area that is electrically active, rather it's going to involve numerous brain areas being active in concert and to different degrees. In the same way that the keys on a piano together played in the appropriate sequence represent a particular song. You would never say that one key on the piano represents that song, but that key is necessary. Similarly in the brain, we can say that a brain area might be necessary, but not sufficient to give us a particular experience or generate a particular behavior.

I also would have thought that if a goal is really easy to achieve, that it would engage the systems of action in the brain and body enough that people would sort of get into motion and pursue that goal. But neither is the case. Again, set goals that are difficult to achieve, but that are not so lofty that they collapse your system and that you feel overwhelmed. And the important thing here is that how we perceive a goal, whether or not we think it's within reach or not, of course will vary depending on whether or not we are rested, depending on whether or not other aspects of our life are going well. I mean, we can think that we are hot on the heels of a lifetime goal and everything's going well, and then there'll be some crisis, interpersonal crisis, or there'll be a health crisis and you'll be shut down.

Although, as I mentioned before, they've done similar studies looking at cognitive type work. And what they did is they had a group of people exercise wearing 15 pound ankle weights, and they had to basically move a certain distance or run a certain distance to reach a goal line. One group was focused on the goal line, visually focused on the goal line. The other group was not told to visually focus on the goal line. And what they found was that the group that focused on the goal line was able to achieve reaching that goal with 17% less effort. They measured effort and it got there 23% quicker.

If you're somebody who's interested in business, or let's say you're focused on relationship, is thinking about the perfect relationship and what that would look like and the family that you would have and where you would live, is that effective in generating the kinds of behaviors that will lead you to that? Is it effective to think about the big win at the end? Well, it turns out it is, but you have to be very, very careful with when and how you implement that visualization.
