Of course, that never happens to me, but it may happen to you. Of course, it happens to me. But the idea is to stay calm in your mind so that then you can regulate your action, right? And so I think that there are these practices that one can develop over time that are really straightforward and zero cost, right? You could find any number of ways to increase your adrenaline and stay calm. And we tend to focus on things like exercise as the way that we get our energy up. But today, again, I'm talking about deliberately increasing adrenaline while staying calm mentally, because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events, through things that we didn't seek out. So the ability to regulate adrenaline and cortisol is about inducing them deliberately when you want to push back on infection, potential infection from bacteria or viruses.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System Function,\" Andrew Huberman discusses the importance of cortisol and adrenaline in regulating energy levels and immune system function.

So they're going to bias you towards more stress in other domains. Remember, cortisol can cross the blood brain barrier. So you're going to be more prone to psychological stress. I also want to mention again again that I think there's great benefit to having a practice that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can't, maybe every third day or every other day of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind so that you learn to separate the brain body experience. You know, we hear so much about how beneficial it is to unify the brain and body that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies. I particularly dislike claims like that or statements like that, because there's great power as we learned today in having your body activated by some sort of stimulus, cold water, or even psychological stress, but learning to stay calm in your mind.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety,\" Andrew Huberman delves into the science behind stress and emotions, exploring how to understand, manage, and leverage stress for health benefits. He explains the biology of stress, debunking myths and highlighting its role in aligning our internal state with external experiences. Huberman discusses the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, their functions, and how they can be harnessed through breathing techniques like the physiological sigh to regulate stress responses in real-time.\n\nHe also addresses the positive aspects of acute stress, such as its capacity to enhance focus and immune function, and introduces breathing exercises that can induce a beneficial stress response to combat infection. Huberman emphasizes the importance of managing medium-term stress by increasing our stress threshold through practices that dissociate the mind's calmness from the body's heightened state.\n\nFor long-term stress, he underscores the significance of social connection and its relationship with neuromodulators like serotonin, which can foster feelings of well-being\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: A lot of stress inoculation, a lot of managing medium term stress on the timescale of weeks, or maybe even a couple months. So we're not talking about years of stress. A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold. It's about capacity. And there are very simple tools, excellent tools that will allow us to modulate our capacity for stress. And they look a lot like the tools I just described. They involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat, not to the extreme, and then when we feel flooded with adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally, calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body. So unlike trying to unify the mind and body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I actually do as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological size in real time. You can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection if you're feeling kind of run down.\n------------------------\n"], "success": true, "metricsMetadata": [{"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.9, "reason": "The actual output accurately addresses how to deliberately increase adrenaline while staying mentally calm through practices like breathing techniques, cold exposure, and psychological stress.

But as you can quickly see, we are going to have different types of headaches and different approaches to treating headache. But if you keep in the back of your mind that you have neurons that contract muscles to create movement or tension of muscles, remember you can turn off those neurons and allow those muscles to relax. You have sensory neurons that sense input and actually sense the pain. And you have modulatory neurons, which can allow you to adjust the relationship between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons.

And laboratories, both in the United States, which is Chufu's, and elsewhere are starting to find the underlying mechanisms. And those mechanisms include deactivation of the pain pathways, activation of some of the parallel pathways that assist in shutting down pain or in relaxing the muscles that are causing tension type headache, as well as activation of neural pathways that impinge on organs that then cause or reduce the release of molecules into the body that give us the experience of pain.

And that maps very well to what's known about the neural circuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting your body and brain into a mode of activation, getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure that puts you into forward motion towards your goals is absolutely key. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. There were other things too, of course, the dopamine system and the power of subjective top-down control in regulating that dopamine system.

Rather, if you are not feeling motivated, then what the scientific literature tells us is that you actually want to spend one to three, maybe five minutes visualizing failure, visualizing how terrible you will feel if you do not achieve your goal, visualizing severe consequences, perhaps mostly of the sort like telling yourself, gosh, I set a goal, I set a 12 week block, I quantify it, I know I want to do this, here I have the time to do it and I'm simply just not doing it.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement.

I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say, oh, I need a drink and then they have a drink and they're like, calm down. Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work. They can start to think about things in a maybe more grounded or rational way, or at least they believe that, or they can somehow just relax themselves. Well, while that very well may be true, that it can relax them, when they are not drinking, that level of cortisol that's released at baseline has increased substantially. Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit between brain and body, and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol to some of the other hormones involved in the stress response. We'll provide a reference to the study that describes how all of this works for those of you that really want to delve into it. But let's go back to this issue of those who are prone to alcoholism versus those who are not. Remember, there are people who have genetic variants that meaning genes that they inherited their parents, that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the comprehensive effects of alcohol on the body, brain, and overall health.

Well, those people experience changes in their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis that result in more cortisol, more of this so-called stress hormone being released at baseline when they are not drinking. This is really important. People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit, I don't mean one or two sips or even a glass of wine every once in a while. I mean, again, people that are maybe having one drink a night with dinner and maybe on the weekend, a few more. Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns to explain how it could also be two or three drinks on Friday or six drinks only on Saturday. Well, all of those groups experience increases in cortisol release from their adrenal glands when they are not drinking.

Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that you couldn't get to the very same place without it by simply doing a slightly longer gratitude practice or putting a little bit more mental effort into it. That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity really resides in not just one approach, not just neurochemistry and taking substances to increase neuroplasticity, not just behavioral practices to try and increase neuroplasticity, not just brain machine interfaces or devices to increase neuroplasticity, but rather the convergence of multiple tools. So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, as we say in the brain, using something like KANA combined with a gratitude practice in the not too distant future.

They explore the implications of this technology for conditions like depression, OCD, autism, and blindness. Additionally, they delve into the future of psychiatric treatment, the challenges of specificity in medication, and the potential for non-invasive treatments informed by optogenetic research. Dr. Deisseroth also shares insights on the art and science of psychiatry, the importance of understanding patients' experiences, and the potential for brain-machine interfaces in mental health treatment.\nShow Guest: Dr. Karl Deisseroth\nTranscript: Are these opening up new paths or representations of paths into the future? MDMA, ecstasy, is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. And I realize that the neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin often work in concert, not alone, the way they're commonly described in the more general popular discussions. However, it is a unique compound and it's different than the serotonergic compounds like LSD and psilocybin. And there are now data still emerging that it might be, and in some cases can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and similar things. Why would that work? And a larger question, perhaps the more important question is psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds, in my mind, there are two components. There's the experience you have while you're on them. And then there's the effect they have after. People are generating variations of these compounds that are non-hallucinatory variations.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, there are forms of pharmacology that can shift brain neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in ways that favor creativity. And this is certainly a topic that we will go into in more depth in a future episode, but there's an exciting study that was performed just this last year, looking at the role of serotonin, another neuromodulator, in divergent and convergent thinking. And it turns out that serotonin underlies a lot of the brain activity that's responsible for both divergent and for convergent thinking. And there's one particular form of pharmacology, which can enhance activation of the serotonergic pathways associated with the so-called 5-HT, that's serotonin, 5-HT, that's the abbreviation, 5-HT2A receptor, serotonin 2A receptor in particular brain areas in ways that favor both divergent and convergent thinking. And the pharmacologic agent in that case turns out to be very low dose, or as some of you may have heard of it referred to as micro dosing of psilocybin.\n------------------------\n"], "success": true, "metricsMetadata": [{"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.9, "reason": "The actual output is accurate, comprehensive, and effectively addresses the input query regarding substances and practices that could enhance serotonergic transmission and creativity.

Can brain activity of some sort transmit, at least in these worms? I said, Noah, I said this disclaimer multiple times in members we don't know, times will tell. In worms we know a lot. So can worms transmit brain activity to, do they have the specificity to do it? Okay. Before I'll say that, I'll just say that we over the years learned a lot about the mechanisms that shuttle the RNAs between generations. We know about genes that are needed just for that.

They can overlap for sure, but different languages use different sound elements, combine and recombine those elements to give rise to different words and meanings. Can we say that there is a most complicated language out there or among the most complicated, would it be Russian? It's definitely high up there. English is up there too, actually. Yeah, German as well. And in terms of learning multiple languages during development, my understanding is that if one wants to become bilingual or trilingual, best to learn those languages simultaneously during development, ideally before age 12, if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later.

And one point I want to make about it is this, is that in English, for example, there are about 40 different phonemes. Phonemes are just consonants or vowels or individual speech segments. But these articulatory features that you refer to, for example, the characteristic sounds that are generated by specific movements in the mouth, you can more or less reduce that to about 12 different features. Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue, the jaw, the lips, the larynx. There are about 12 of these movements. And just like you said, Andrew, by themselves, they have no meaning. They're just movements. But what's incredible about it is that you take these 12 movements and you put them in combinations and you start putting them in sequence. We as humans use those 12 set of features to generate all words. And because we can generate nearly an infinite number of words with that code of just 12 features, we have something that generates essentially all possible meaning. Because that's what we do as humans. We generate meanings.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In episode 87 of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Erich Jarvis, a neurobiologist exploring the complexities of vocal learning, speech, and language.

They discuss the intricate relationship between speech, language, and movement, such as dance, and how these elements are intertwined both biologically and cognitively. They also delve into the idea that reading engages sub-perceptual motor activity in the throat, reflecting internalized speech. The conversation covers the potential evolutionary pathway from innate vocalizations to learned speech and the concept of critical periods for language acquisition. Dr. Jarvis's research suggests that the brain regions associated with speech production may have evolved from those involved in controlling body movement, leading to the unique human capacity for sophisticated language and even the ability to dance\nShow Guest: Dr. Erich Jarvis\nTranscript: And so you narrow down the ones you use to string the phonemes together in the words that you learn, and you maintain those phonemes as an adult. And here comes along another language that's using those phonemes or in different combinations you're not used to. And therefore, it's like starting from first principles. But if you already have them in multiple languages that you're using, then it makes it easier to use them in another third or fourth language. I see. Incredible. So it's not like your brain has maintained greater plasticity. It's your brain has maintained greater ability to produce different sounds that then allows you to learn another language faster. Got it. Are the hand gestures associated with sounds or with meanings of words? I think the hand gestures are associated with both the sounds and the meaning. When I say sound, like if you are really angry, right, and you are making a loud screaming noise, right, you may make hand gestures that look like you're going to beat the wall, right?

So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over.

However, when it comes to learning and improving performance in the cognitive or physical domain, they are not equivalent. So this is the second principle of mental training and visualization. As you recall, the first principle of mental training and visualization was that in order to make it effective, it needs to be very brief and very simple and repeated over and over again. The second principle of mental training and visualization is that while yes, mental training and visualization recaptures the same patterns of neural firing in the exact same ways as real world behavior and thinking, it is not as effective as real world behavior and thinking. In other words, if you want to learn something, the ideal situation is to combine real training in the physical world with mental training.

And in doing so, we can really stamp down a third principle of mental training and visualization, which is that your mental training and visualization will be far more effective if you are performing the exact same or very similar mental and physical tasks in the real world.

Second is that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world motor training or cognitive training. It's an augment. It's an addition that can really help. And the third principle of mental training and visualization is that you need to combine mental training and visualization with real world behaviors and experiences that are very, very similar.

Okay, so this study is one of several, but not a tremendous number of studies out there that are starting to really pinpoint the underlying neural circuits that allow mental training and visualization to really improve motor skill performance. But again, and please hear me on this, in this study and in the vast majority of other studies that have shown significant improvement in motor performance in the real world by use of mental training and visualization, there was an ability of each and every one in the study to perform the specific motor sequence in the real world that then they were able to enhance with mental training and visualization. Now, thus far, we've been talking mostly about performance of motor sequences. And one of the things to really understand about performance of motor sequences, both in the real world and in the imagined context is that it involves the doing, that's what we call a go action and not doing certain things.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode with Andrew Huberman discusses the science behind mental training and visualization techniques and their impact on learning and performance across various domains.

What's been shown over and over again in this literature is that performing mental training and visualization repeatedly and in a very restricted way that makes it easier to perform those trials over and over and over again, and with a high degree of accuracy, almost always, really we can fairly say in essentially every study where it's been explored has led to improvements in real world performance of both cognitive and or physical tasks. So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over.

So they are prone to concussions and head injuries simply by virtue of their work without any millions of dollars contracts or the opportunity to necessarily, in some cases they do, but necessarily to do other things. And certainly car accidents or bicycle accidents are not voluntary events. So the point being traumatic brain injury and headache related traumatic brain injury extends far beyond the realm of sports.

Keeping in mind, of course, that football is this very salient example of traumatic brain injury and concussion as is boxing, as is even soccer with heading of the ball, believe it or not, repeated low level impact to the forehead and other parts of the head can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion or being quote unquote knocked out. But sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion. Most traumatic brain injury and concussion and low level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living, that is lowered cognition, disruption in mood, sleep, et cetera, is actually the consequence of things other than sports. So for instance, bicycle accidents, playground accidents, construction accidents, and this is often forgotten.

For some reason, football and hockey and boxing get all the attention. But my colleagues that work on traumatic brain injury tell me that most of the traumatic brain injury they see is somebody slips at a party and hits their head or is in a car accident or environmental accidents of various kinds. To my mind, most helmets don't actually cover this region close to the eyes. So is there also a failure of helmet engineering that, you know, I can understand why you'd want to have your peripheral vision out the sides of your eyes, periphery of your eyes, but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate, why isn't it being better protected? You know, I'm no expert in helmets, but I don't think we see a lot of epidural hematomas in sports injuries. To get this kind of injury, you usually need a really focal blunt trauma, like the baseball bat to the head is a classic mechanism of injury that would lead to a temporal bone fracture and epidural hematoma.

Huberman highlights select protocols he has incorporated into his routine that are fun and time-efficient and encourages listeners to tailor these strategies to their goals without significantly increasing workout duration.\n\nKey components of any fitness program consist of a combination of cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. The episode emphasizes the necessity of including different training types (like zone two cardio, strength sessions, and different cardiovascular workouts) and recovery to make continuous progress.\n\nSpecific tools discussed include \"meshing\" zone two cardio with daily activities, like walking, to hit the recommended 200 minutes per week without additional scheduling.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Now, the one exception to this that I incorporated was that for very small muscle groups, so for instance, the rear deltoids, or for neck work, or for calf work, to not rely purely on three to five repetitions, but maybe to work in a range of anywhere from five to eight repetitions. So still fairly low repetitions, but not so low that it restricts you to three to five repetitions. The reason for that is that I, and I think a lot of people out there, find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately with good form when restricting oneself to those low repetitions. However, for big compound movements like presses and squats and deadlifts and glute ham raises and things of that sort, maybe even leg extensions and leg curls, which are isolation exercises, of course, to really restrict oneself to those three to five repetition ranges that take you to failure or near failure. I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced, and I'm confident that you will also experience a lot of benefits. So just to remind you what some of those benefits are, you get stronger, which feels great. That occurs within your weight workouts, but it also carries over to your endurance training sessions.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab guest series episode with Dr. Andy Galpin, they discuss the science and methods to increase strength, hypertrophy (muscle growth), and endurance. Dr. Galpin highlights the importance of strength and hypertrophy training for everyone, not just athletes, as it combats neuromuscular aging and preserves muscle function. He clarifies that strength training is essential for maintaining muscle power and strength, which is crucial for everyday movements and preventing falls as we age. The conversation also touches on the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training for cognitive function, immune health, and overall longevity. Dr. Galpin dispels misconceptions about strength training, emphasizing that it can be started at any age and is not solely for building muscle mass, but also for maintaining functional abilities. He also discusses the neuromuscular adaptations that occur with strength training, such as improved nerve firing, muscle contractility, and changes in muscle fiber type.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: But in reality, if it is, you can do whatever you would like. Tell me if this is a reasonable structure, given what you've told us. Three exercises per muscle group. First exercise, slightly heavier loads. So repetition ranges somewhere between, let's say, five and eight, with perhaps hitting failure or close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between two or let's, let's get wild and say five minutes. Okay. So it's a little bit more of a strength type workout at that point, but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition ranges now eight to 15, shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so. And then on the third exercise, repetition ranges of 12 to 30. This number 30 kind of makes me wide-eyed when I think about it. I can't remember the last time I did a set of 30 thinking it was for hypertrophy, but what you're saying makes absolute sense and is research-backed. So very short rest intervals, maybe 30 seconds between sets. Would that allow somebody to target all three forms of major adaptation? I mean, in my mind it works.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast #94 titled \"Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health,\" Andrew Huberman discusses science-based tools to optimize physical health, covering various fitness aspects such as endurance, strength, flexibility, hypertrophy, and more. He proposes a general fitness protocol that individuals can adapt to pursue specific fitness goals such as increased strength or endurance. Huberman outlines his workout schedule, emphasizing training large muscle groups like legs and adjusting for recovery and biomechanical safety with activities such as heat-cold contrast sessions for recovery.\n\nThe podcast also explores the benefits of long endurance workouts, the importance of resistance training coupled with tailored sets and repetitions for hypertrophy or strength gains, and the significance of incorporating neck exercises for overall stability and safety. Huberman reinforces the necessity of balancing fitness types throughout the week, providing a foundation for full-body health.\n\nAdditionally, he announces the launch of the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel, offering in-depth responses to listener questions and exclusive content.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So it might be anywhere from three to four sets per exercise. Again, still just two exercises and longer rest between sets, anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes if it's really heavy leg work. And then for the next month, switch to repetition range that's closer to eight to 12, maybe even 15 repetitions per set, but do fewer sets overall. So maybe just two to three sets per exercise, again, just two exercises per muscle group typically. And shorten the rest between sets so that it's more in the 90 second, maybe even as short as 60 seconds rest between sets, but typically 90 seconds to about two minutes or two and a half minutes. So basically it's one month heavier, the next month slightly lighter, although I wouldn't say light, I would say moderate weight and moderate rep range. That tends to work well for me. It also adheres to a principle that came up during the discussion, again, with Dr. Andy Galpin, that for hypertrophy, you really can use repetition ranges anywhere from five to 30, three zero reps.

I'm also trying to take that visual window and actually pay attention to more of the details at that location.

If I attach more detail and effort to the specific thing that I'm focused on, is there any evidence that that's more effective? It certainly, you know, changes what our brains are doing. So, you know, how do we define effectiveness? That's a question for philosophers and that scientists will always- Will it keep me running? Yeah. It will when you use it towards the end of your run, just like you've picked up on. Yeah.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And so next we're going to talk about what the literature says about things like visualization, immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals, and how to best achieve those. And then we're going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use. It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you, the listeners, in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice that you can do anytime, any place to really identify what it is specifically that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal. Focusing our visual attention on one particular point is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit. And if you'd like to read some of the scientific studies or read a review of the scientific studies that have looked at how narrowing one's visual attention can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals, I'll put a link to this study. The title of the study is Keeping the Goal in Sight, Testing the Influence of Narrowed Visual Attention on Physical Activity. And this is a paper from Emily Balsettis' lab. It focuses mainly on physical activities, but it mentioned some other things as well. This is an article published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the \"Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals\" episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses strategies for setting and achieving personal goals. He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\nTranscript: And it allows you to increase your level of focus, your level of motivation, and the sustainability of your focus and motivation while in goal pursuit. So it's a quite valuable protocol to incorporate, and it's something that you can do once for 30 seconds and then lean into whatever it is, your writing process, your running process. It's something that you could do repeatedly throughout that learning bout, and it's something that you can practice offline a little bit away from that training bout as a means to sort of learn and get familiar with so that then you can incorporate it very quickly and repeatedly and with much more effectiveness during these different learning bouts. Again, it's a highly valuable tool that's grounded in neural circuitry, grounded in neurochemistry, and that Emily Balchettis' lab has shown in numerous domains, physical pursuits, cognitive pursuits can really help people achieve their goals and to achieve them more easily, or at least with less perceived effort and more quickly.

He emphasizes the importance of focused attention, alertness, and the use of certain neurochemicals like epinephrine and acetylcholine to facilitate plasticity. Practical advice is given on how to improve focus, including managing sleep, motivation, and practicing visual focus. Huberman also touches on the use of pharmacology, like caffeine or nicotine, to enhance alertness and cholinergic transmission, which can aid in the neuroplasticity process. The episode provides insights into how we can harness our brain's plasticity to learn and adapt at any age, given the right conditions and practices.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Spending just 60 to 120 seconds focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen, meaning just on my screen with nothing on it, but bringing my eyes to that particular location increases not just my visual acuity for that location, but it brings about an increase in activity in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated with gathering information from this location. So put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus, practice visual focus. Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses, that's fine. You of, would want to use those. You don't want to take those off and use a blurry image. The finer the visual image and the more that you can hold your gaze to that visual image, the higher your levels of attention will be. Many times on Instagram, and here I've been teased for not blinking very often. That's actually a practiced thing. We blink more as we get tired, which as you hear it, you'll probably just say, duh. As we get tired, the neurons in the brainstem that are responsible for alertness and that hold the eyelids open start to falter and our eyelids start to close.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So what is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location? Well, it turns out that we have two branches of our visual system. So visual information all comes in through our eyes, but then it can head down two different pathways. One pathway is engaged when our vision is brought to a common point, what we call a vergence eye movement. So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point, regardless of how far away from us that point is, our visual system engages a certain set of neurons, neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time. Just think of it as a very detailed camera of the visual world. And it tends to be very restricted. The other pathway through the visual system is a so-called Magnocellular pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking in global information about lots of things that are happening around us, movement of things to our right, movement of things to our left, things that are happening down on the ground and all around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural circuits that are associated with alertness and attention.\n------------------------\n"], "success": true, "metricsMetadata": [{"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.9, "reason": "The actual output accurately describes the 'black belt' or high level version of visual focus mentioned in the transcript, which involves not only focusing on a specific location but also increasing screen brightness and paying more attention to details at that location.

For years, I had the same recurring nightmare over and over and over again. And it was so salient and so clear. And I'm not going to share what it is because it's not that it's that disturbing. It was just, I think it was the emotional load of it and just how salient certain features were. Like one person who's a real life person had a particular clothing on. And it's like, and that just served as this cue. And I don't know if I ever did any direct work to try and deal with it, but now it almost seems silly to describe it. Oh yeah. Well, dreams are usually silly to describe. Yeah, it was pretty silly, but it was a pretty violent dream. Yeah. And your emotional system is so geared up during REM sleep, which is another thing we could talk about.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode featuring Dr. Gina Poe, the discussion centers on how sleep influences learning, memory, and emotional well-being, focusing on the brain activity during different sleep phases.

And it took several nights, as I recall, or more, but that they were able to escape this recurring nightmare. Yeah, it was like a week or something. Right. Oh, so you're familiar with this study. Yeah, that's a beautiful study. I loved it. Yeah, we will put a reference to that. I need to revisit that study. It was pretty recent, but I need to dive into it again because I think I didn't go as deep into it as I should have. No, no, but the one thing that you, well, you said many right things, but one of the things you said is that they were able to cue the dreamer when they knew when they were going to REM sleep and then they played the sound or had the odor.\n------------------------\n", "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode featuring Dr. Gina Poe, the discussion centers on how sleep influences learning, memory, and emotional well-being, focusing on the brain activity during different sleep phases.

So that sound is now this new thing that it should be associated with safety. And that might be enough, maybe, I hope, to knock you out of that repeated nightmare and maybe even start you on the path to recovery because if you can calm down about those nightmare states of sleep then maybe your locus surrealis which is involved in stress can also relax and you can do the erasure parts that need to be done i love it i seem to recall a paper and i'll have to find the reference and and um send it to you we will also put in the show note captions that described a protocol that essentially matches this idea. And I think what they had people do was either cue themselves to a particular smell or tone in wakefulness, then to try and recall a recurring nightmare. Then during the night's sleep, they had the tone playing in the background, which would then cue them to the wakeful state. They're still asleep, mind you, but in the pseudo lucid or lucid state. And then try and change some variable, as you're describing. Some either look the predator in the eyes or do something different.\n------------------------\n"], "success": true, "metricsMetadata": [{"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.9, "reason": "The actual output accurately reflects the context and comprehensively addresses how the guest cued herself to deal with the recurring nightmare by rehearsing a different narrative before sleep and using sound cues associated with safety, closely following the evaluation steps.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "Custom Anthropic Model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229"}], "runDuration": 2.4333932820009068}], "conversationalTestCases": [], "metricsScores": [], "runDuration": 0.0}
