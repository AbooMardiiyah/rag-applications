Finally\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success can be useful at the outset of a goal and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal, but that it's not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal. Rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure and all the terrible things that it's going to bring seems to be more effective. And that maps very well to what's known about the neural circuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting your body and brain into a mode of activation, getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure that puts you into forward motion towards your goals is absolutely key. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. There were other things too, of course, the dopamine system and the power of subjective top-down control in regulating that dopamine system. But I want to be sure to include a tool that's been especially powerful for me, that's grounded in the neuroscience research and in the psychology research.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \\\"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\\\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement.

Talked about the beautiful work of Emily Balsettis at New York University and her work on the use of the visual system to better achieve goals. And indeed things like visualization and why forecasting failure can be more effective than forecasting success as counterintuitive as that might seem. That's what the data point to. And we talked about the importance of setting concrete plans and really what that means and what intervals at which to assess progress and what intervals at which to assess reward and how the dopamine system is involved. And in addition, I described this practice that one can incorporate as a daily or semi-daily practice of so-called space-time bridging, of using the visual system and your ability to deliberately step your visual system from stations that are within your body, so-called peripersonal or interoceptive space, out into the world further and further, and then back again in sequence as a way to harness and cultivate and build up these systems that link vision, space, time, reward systems, and so forth.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In the \\\"Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals\\\" episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses strategies for setting and achieving personal goals. He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\\nTranscript: However, if you arrive to your practice, meaning you show up to the piano to learn piano, or you're sitting down to the table, or maybe you haven't even gotten enough motivation to go toward the piano or toward your notebook or computer or whatever landscape it is that you are going to be pursuing your goal within, and you are having, quote unquote, a hard time getting motivated toward that goal, well, then it turns out, what the scientific literature tells us, is that visualizing the end, keeping the end in mind, positive visualization of all the good things that you'll experience when you achieve that goal is not going to be an effective strategy to motivate you. Rather, if you are not feeling motivated, then what the scientific literature tells us is that you actually want to spend one to three, maybe five minutes visualizing failure, visualizing how terrible you will feel if you do not achieve your goal, visualizing severe consequences, perhaps mostly of the sort like telling yourself, gosh, I set a goal, I set a 12 week block, I quantify it, I know I want to do this, here I have the time to do it and I'm simply just not doing it.\\n------------------------\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8568562526870267, "reason": "The actual output is largely consistent with the retrieval context, accurately reflecting the discussion on the effectiveness of visualizing failure as a motivation strategy, as mentioned in the podcast summaries.

I sort of blew right past it, but the fact that in upwards of 25% of young people are taking things like Adderall despite not having a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. Well, that's a ridiculously high number. A few years ago, it was estimated that Adderall use and Ritalin use without diagnosis of ADHD was second in incident only to cannabis. But actually now the consumption of Adderall without prescription is higher than the consumption of cannabis in that age group. So what that means is that there's a lot of stimulant use in that age group. And there are a lot of adults also using and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus. Now we could have a whole discussion about whether or not life is becoming more demanding, whether or not the need for focus is excessive, and that's why people are doing that.

In fact, some surveys reveal that as high as 80% of college age young adults have used one or several of prescription drugs such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, or similar at some point and are doing so without a prescription. So they are either obtaining those drugs from those that do have prescriptions for them for ADHD, or they are obtaining them through black market sources, which of course carries an additional and very serious risk related to the so-called fentanyl crisis that is as high as 75% of black market drugs nowadays of various kinds, but certainly including the sorts of drugs we're going to talk about today are contaminated with fentanyl and therefore are very deadly.\\n------------------------\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8552181511981021, "reason": "The actual output closely aligns with the retrieval context, confirming factual accuracy regarding the prevalence of Adderall and Ritalin use without an ADHD diagnosis among young people.

There is this idea, and I'll say it so that you don't have to, that dates back to Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution, very controversial, right? And maybe not even controversial. I think it's very like offensive even to certain people. This idea of inheritance of acquired traits, the idea that one could change themselves through some activity, use the example of going to the gym. We could also use the example of somebody who becomes an endurance runner, then decides to have children within another endurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this running and not just because they were biased towards running in the first place, but because of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners. Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong. So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits? What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion? Right.

Otherwise, if in the beginning we ask how does it stop after one generation, now we have to ask why doesn't it last forever? And it doesn't. Typically, we see that the responses last not only with the viral resistance, but also with other traits for a few generations, three to five generations. We found genes that function as a sort of a clock that times the duration of the inheritance. What sorts of genes are those? So we call these genes MOTEC genes. MOTEC, I don't know how is your Hebrew, but MOTEC, it means sweetheart in Hebrew. But the acronym is Modified Transgenerational Epigenetic Kinetics. There are different types of genes like that. And for some of them, if you mutate, if you disrupt their function, now the effect would transmit stably for hundreds of generations. It would never stop. Because their role is to stop the inheritance from just, you don't want to carry over something forever, otherwise it will no longer fit the environment of the parents, and you'll be prepared for the wrong things.
