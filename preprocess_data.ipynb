       "[{'content': \"Hello, and welcome to the FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast. I'm Galen Druk. Game time for the Republican presidential primary begins in earnest this week. The first debate is being held in Milwaukee on Wednesday, and it marks the beginning of a five-month countdown to the Iowa caucuses, during which there will be monthly debates, nonstop campaigning, and a likely winnowing of the field. As summer winds down and voters train more of their attention on the primary, we'll also see whether any of the candidates are able to take former President Trump down a peg. He currently leads our national polling average with 54% support, and at the time of this recording, reporting has just come out suggesting that Trump is going to skip the debate in favor of an interview with Tucker Carlson. As an aside, we're recording this on Friday because I'm going to be running around Milwaukee on Monday. But in any case, while this may be when the nation begins to tune in, folks in the early states have been tuning in, either by choice or because of multi-million dollar ad spending, for months. And so today, in preparation for the months ahead, we're going to take in the view from the early states. And to do that, I've asked a few local reporters to join me.\",\n",

       " {'content': \"So folks get excited. But let's begin here. As I mentioned, the national polling picture has Trump leading with 54%. After that, DeSantis has 16% support, then Ramaswamy with 8%, Pence with 5%, Haley with 4%, Christie and Scott with 3% each, and then on down from there, descending to zero support for some of the candidates. But the lineups in the early states can look quite a bit different based on who's managing to connect with voters there. So Katie, let's start in Iowa. How is the picture different on the ground there? So the big thing about Iowa is that since we are the first state to caucus, you know, a lot of these candidates, especially some of the lesser known candidates, spend an incredible amount of time and money here. So I believe if this is coming out on Monday, we'll have a new Iowa poll out. So go look at that.\",\n",

No, I guess I would just say that, you know, at this point, we are on alert for things to be shaken up here a little bit, just because people in Iowa have a lot more time to, you know, go out, see the candidates, get to know them. And, you know, some of the lesser known candidates have been spending a lot of time here. And honestly, some of the better known candidates have also been spending a lot of time here. I mean, DeSantis has been doing a bus tour the last couple weeks, he's had many stops in the state, and Trump just swung by the state fair.
