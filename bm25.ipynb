And he's just taken off of those networks and as a consequence, hundreds of millions of people that would be regularly engaging with him in real time suddenly can't see it. That wasn't a decision that was made by a government. It wasn't a decision made by a judge or by a regulatory authority or even by a multinational organization like, you know, the UN. It was made by individuals that own tech companies. The same thing is true in the decision to help Ukraine in the war. In the early days, the U.S. didn't provide much military support.\",\n",
