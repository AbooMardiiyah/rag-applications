Financial security, healthcare, education, and all of these problems are now being solved by great entrepreneurs, so whether you look at the space, it's Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, or even our Moon Express that's completely changing the way people look at the space. Healthcare is completely being redone as opposed to really looking at the symptom of the problem and solving the symptom is completely preventing from disease from happening, and that's my new venture called Viome, where we are actually believe that disease can actually be just a choice, not a matter of bad luck. It could be just a matter of choice, and we are going to make that happen. Second reason what's happening is the entrepreneurs can be held responsible every single day, not every election cycle.

So we found a collection of little hacks and cultural transformations and companies that allow you to basically operate in this new modality, being very curious, purpose driven, constantly testing assumptions, using small agile teams, operating at the edges as autonomously as possible, and then getting the business of the organization done. Wow. I love that so much. I've taken a lot from Bezos over the years, like he's got some really amazing ideas. I do have to chuckle a little bit that this business genius still got taken down by dick pics, but just the human mind is absolutely hilarious. You're all frail. But yeah, none of that, look, I don't even throw shade at the guy, get it, live your best life. But that's really brilliant.\",\n",
