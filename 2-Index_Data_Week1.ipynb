Then you start to develop this full relationship, this balanced relationship that then stays with you for the rest of your life. I'll tell you what. If you were to take 100 people who have been consistently, appropriately exercising for 10 years, people who are consistent with it, people who've developed a good relationship with it, tell them to list the top five reasons why they continue to do it. And I bet you how they look won't make the top five. I bet you number one has to do with something mental. I feel better, I have better energy, it makes me more positive than depression or anxiety. How they look won't make the top five, trip off that. And yet the number one reason why people approach exercise is to change how they look.\",\n",

So who is it that you're actually trying to become? The important thing is to make sure that you know what your value system is, you know what you value, then we know what you're actually striving towards. Once you have a goal, that goal makes demands. So if you're trying to be the kind of person that gets up early so that you can see your kids before you send them off to school, then you need to be the kind of person that either deals with fatigue all the time, which I think is a terrible idea and I do not recommend, or you need to be the kind of person that goes to bed early. That's one of the myriad ways that your goal is going to mandate your behavior.\",\n",

I think it is, but focus on the good stuff and focus on the potential of what happens on the scales to make real positive change. It can be to your pocket. It can be to your community. It can be to your life because it does affect everyone that you know. So I'd go with a positive mindset, leave it to boring old guys like us to think about all the doom scenarios. Fair enough.
