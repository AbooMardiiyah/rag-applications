And when you were talking about it, I was like, okay, why would she get mad about that? Well, not crazy, but that everybody should do that work because I was saying that everyone should have that opportunity. To me, the ultimate anti-elitist belief that even her father who drove a truck could have been an artist, could have created something. Through driving or in some other capacity? In some other capacity. Interesting. What about the idea of doing the driving so well that it becomes artistry? I said that if that was what fulfilled him, I have no problem with that.

You're a conscious parent. Tom Bilyeu Or at least recognizing enough that that would be a true pre-parent. Dr. Shefali You haven't messed any kid up yet.

They want to be like you. That's a natural attachment drive. So if you show up as a loving, nurturing, parental figure, the kid will naturally want to emulate you and copy you. Number three, the child will want to be good for you without any coercion whatsoever.
