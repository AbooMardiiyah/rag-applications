Long-term potentiation involves the strengthening of particular connections between neurons. The connection sites between neurons we call synapses. Actually, technically synapses are the gaps between those connections, but nonetheless, synapses are the point of communication between neurons and those can be strengthened so that certain neurons can talk to other neurons more robustly than they happened to before.\", \"Neuroplasticity is our nervous system, which of course includes the brain, the spinal cord, and all the connections between the brain and spinal cord and the organs and tissues of the body, and then all the neural connections back from the organs and tissues of the body to the brain and spinal cord, so the whole thing in both directions, has the ability to change in response to experience in ways that are adaptive. That is, that allows us to do things that we could not do before.\", \"The noise goes up and the signal goes down. Again, incredibly important set of findings.
