Your motivation for sitting here right now, my motivation for answering these questions, the reason that we put these cameras together, built this channel, all of it is for one thing, because nature wants to make sure that you have kids that have kids. That's it. And now everything in your brain is nature pulling levers to make sure that you live long enough to have kids that have kids and that you actually have kids. So love, which I will say is a neurochemical state, is nature's way of going, yo, I want to make sure you do this thing. So it's this incredible cocktail of, I mean, obviously there's different kinds of love. I will assume you mean romantic love since you referenced my relationship.",

In fact, let the pain sink in and let it be your driver. Then once you get past those, then other things kick in that can be your motivator, which I hope we get to talk about today.

It's all the same stuff going on in there. The question is, how the heck does your qualia of vision feel such that you would never confuse it with a sound? If I did a sound, you wouldn't think, oh yeah, that looks like something. I have a hypothesis on this.

Joints just because I'm carrying so much weight. Yes. Every time you take a step while walking, your knees are experiencing approximately three times your body weight in terms of force. Jesus.

I mean, of course, we printed trillions and trillions of dollars over the last number of years, but now if you wanted to raise money, venture capital firms are sitting on boatloads of cash, and they're competing against each other to get the best investments.

So thank you so much for everything that you do. I can't thank you enough. I can go on and on about everything. But thank you so much. Keep doing what you're doing. It's just so inspiring. Thank you. Hi, Lisa.",

I don't give a shit. I'll ask questions. I'm not afraid. I transport my, this whole room that I'm in to a different, to my playing field where I know they'd be out of their depth. And I imagine, well, and this could be as simple as, you know, you play Twitch all day and you're a great gamer, whatever it is that you're a little patch of dirt that you own, transport that room to your territory and imagine them out of their depth because everyone's out of their depth and you are always in your element somewhere to immunize yourself from the insecurity. But love the way you put the pieces together for those listening who want to say, okay, but make it even more actionable.",

And I believe intuition is one of those things. This is really fascinating to me, and I promise you I'm exploring this with an open mind. Here's how I look at it. So if you had said humans, this would be a lot easier.",

The way I got past that was small steps before big leaps. Small wins digs you out of big ditches, meaning that, well, I wasn't going to have a book deal in the next few weeks, but what could I do to at least give me more validation and self-confidence? I wrote one article, got that published. Wrote a second article, got that published. Then I started to get a little bit more traction and excitement for what I was doing again. Then I hit up my agent and was like, okay, I'm going to redo the book proposal for the fourth time. A proposal is like 50 pages at least. It's the small little wins that give you the confidence to put yourself out there. If you're looking to get a new job, why not do something small first to give yourself more confidence so in the interview you have a better success rate? That one small thing you can do is maybe a freelance gig. Maybe do someone a favor, something small."
