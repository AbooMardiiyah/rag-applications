One is you can start the treatment in middle age, and really, that was first demonstrated with rapamycin. So that was done in 2009.

So, I do think though I encourage dating apps I think men need to get out more, all right. There was one time I was on a show and they had a call-in section and one of the guys called and he said you know I can't meet any women I don't know what's going on. And long story short we found out that when he would go out he would meet women but he was struggling on online dating. And we're like guy just get out more like you have the answer in front of you.

And because people are kept in the dark about that, then other people are able to use their superior knowledge in an open marketplace to garner more of the money. Or even worse, if the government is using money to either inflate the currency or to redistribute money, which basically is stealing from one person, and yes, I'm using that word very intentionally, to give to other people that have not earned that money. That creates all this contention about how the money should be used, where it should be going. There were people that were up in arms when the airline industry was bailed out, or the banks were bailed out in the 2008 collapse.

Reinforcement learning is all based on this. And you don't need subjective experience for that. So these are really distinct capabilities.

It was a huge fucking failure because we didn't make it to season two. Huge failure in real-world terms. Massive success when it comes to the timeline of my life. And so I'm talking to this person about the talk show.",

As a parent, it's not the same with children. And so we have this long, protracted period where we have to be taken care of, we have to learn how to walk and talk and do all the human-y things.

Printing money is in a sense, like official counterfeiting. And the guy who is about the counterfeited dollar first, can spend that and get more of the purchasing power. And then eventually it makes its way through the system and the entire money supply gets marked down. And it's got less of its purchasing power with the 15th guy who's got it, okay. And so printing is not costless. What printing just does is it's like, basically, inflation is taxation. It's like, let's say you had, I don't know, $100 billion, okay, in the economy as a whole. And then the government prints another $100 billion. That's as if the government seized 50% of the wealth in the country. Does that make sense? Or at least 50% of the savings? Yes.",

And now you've got a bit of a problem because one, you're taking light into your eyes to the timing, you're going to be like, Oh my god, I have to be up in an hour, whatever. It's just all things that are not conducive to falling back asleep. So you want to leave enough time that you can sleep without setting an alarm. There is a potential that electronic devices in your room is problematic. I have not noticed this personally, but there are people that say that they really can tell the difference in the quality of their sleep. I tried tracking it with an aura ring with and without the aura ring turned on with devices around not around. And I just didn't notice a big difference. So I'm not sure that that one is going to be something that's problematic for everybody. But it's certainly worth testing.",
        "YZ9kfXw9H54_7": "Because I feel like there's so much richness of life that I would have missed out on had I stayed in this athletic jock core group that, if I'm generalizing it, just kind of did the same thing and talked the same way and lived a certain lifestyle. I just didn't want to live that life. I wanted to live a life of abundance, of learning, of constantly questioning who I am and if I'm doing things for the greater good or just for myself. So this topic was really a self-discovery. Four years ago, I got in a really big fight. I started getting angrier and angrier in my life. As I was achieving more and more financially, accomplishments, awards, all the nice things that you mentioned in the beginning, as those were happening, I would find myself more and more triggered emotionally from simple attacks that people had on me, whether it be online, on social media, or in person. In my relationship, I was very triggered where I would just get more and more bent out of shape and hurt in certain situations and frustrated and resentful. And one day, I was playing a lot of pickup basketball at this time.",
        "uSgY_PxL_Zo_7": "How much of this is like, oh my God, we're heading towards a cliff? That's a great question. Okay, let me start off with what happened with my first investments. So here it is, it's around 1999, 2000, everybody thinks they're a tech genius. You put money in any stock, it goes up 26% the next day. So what do I do? I take my college scholarship money, and I put some of it in the stock market thinking, this is easy money. 20%. Here we go. Yeah, guarantee. And every day it's going up and down, but mostly up. Was there massive euphoria? I wasn't focused on this at all at the time. Yes, yes. Everybody believed they're a genius. So in a bull market, everybody believes they're a genius, and they all say the same phrase, this time it's different. It's such a funny phrase that in the investment world, people make fun of it. They're mocked because it's never different. It's actually the same thing.",
        "La9oLLoI5Rc_18": "Every time you become aware that you're doing that and your body is craving those emotions and you settle it back down into the present moment, you're telling the body it's no longer the mind, that you're the mind and now your will is getting greater than the program and if you keep doing this over and over again, over and over again, over and over again, just like training a stallion or a dog, it's just going to say, I'm going to sit and the moment that happens and the body is no longer the mind, when it finally surrenders, there's a liberation of energy. We go from particle to wave, from matter to energy and we free ourselves from the chains of those emotions that keep us in the familiar past and we've seen this thousands of times. In fact, we can actually predict it now on a brain scan. I found that so interesting. Let's go a little bit harder on metacognition, the notion that you don't have to believe everything you think. I love the way that you talk about that.",
        "Vs7KtoS0eKI_61": "The critic for me really is sort of that embodiment of, again, our fear of failure, our own worst enemy in our minds. Roosevelt's strongman, on the other hand, is someone who has no use for perfection, only progress. Someone who values effort and growth, whose focus is momentum, the next step. Not this overarching enterprise, this overwhelming endeavor, but what is my next step? For the strongman, success lies in striving, and actually striving towards a noble pursuit, which at the end of the day is the only thing we can control. Whether or not we are striving to our best toward a noble pursuit, and the outcome is less important. It's funny, you mentioned that at the time that I was going through it, I obviously did not know that we were going to turn around ODC construction and it would be a great success. You make a big decision and later it either works out phenomenally well or is a catastrophic failure. Well, it's so tempting in the face of the catastrophic failure to go back and beat yourself up and say, oh, this was the worst decision and I'm an idiot and this was terrible.",
        "Or7CFDgfEYI_125": "If you were about to become a mother, he wanted you to start reading to your baby in utero and to keep reading once they were born. And I was like, whoa, that's one of those insights about the brain, that shit scares me. It scares me, it has become not that age, but that idea has become the central mission of my life. If you can intercept people at the right time with the right idea in the right format, you will change how their brain develops. Exactly, how they see the world. The entire schema, at those early, early ages, we're forming our schema of the world. How the world works, it's really good to intervene early if you want someone not to be screwed up and to work better in this society, yeah. No doubt. But it's incredible. I mean, this guy is probably one of the examples. There are lots of people who are surrounded by horrible situations as they grow up and they're able to, you know, lock onto, latch onto the one role model that's different and that's better. And they're able to not reproduce that same bad situation in their own life when they're adults."
