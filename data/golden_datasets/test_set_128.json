        "CDUetQMKM6g_106": "There was a cult of sorts that were interested in um living forever uh and so they uh castrated the males self-castrated themselves in the idea that somehow um maintaining some pre-pubescent state or reverting to a pseudo prepubescent state would somehow extend longevity the idea that um sexual behavior somehow limited lifespan this has been an idea that's been thrown around in the kind of more wacky longevity communities. They also shaved their heads. They also wore the same sneakers, but then they also all committed suicide right as the Hale-Bopp comet came through town.",
        "DtmwtjOoSYU_137": "And listen, I'm so grateful for this discussion and for you raising these topics. I think that people, you know, many people know your work on testosterone, on stress, and we've covered some of that today. The work on free will and this idea that we are hopeless or that we are in total control, I think I'm realizing and listening to you that neither is true and that the solution resides in understanding more about free will and lack of it and also neuroplasticity. You're working on a book about free will.",
        "FE0lTEUa7EY_14": "They do not feel well, they get foggy headed, they have less energy, there's some malaise, sometimes even some mild depression. And then what they do is they have people take caffeine and take a cognitive exam or do some physical activity and compare their performance to what it was when they were in the withdrawal state. Another typical form of study on caffeine is to take people who are naive to caffeine or who never take caffeine and then have them ingest caffeine and then measure their cognitive and or physical performance. And in both cases, you see improvements.",
        "Z7MU6zrAXsM_126": "And what we see is extraordinary patterns of activity when people hear words and sentences. If you look at that part of the brain that we call Wernicke's area, in this part of the temporal lobe, this whole area lights up when you hear words or speech. And it's not in a way that is like a general light bulb warming up and it's generally lit up, but what you actually see is something much, much more complicated, which is a pattern of activity. And what we've done in the last 10 years is to try to understand what does that pattern come from?",
        "oUu3f0ETMJQ_273": "I'm certain that people are going to start thinking about how to change their relationship with light as a way to anchor everything that they do and that's important to their health. And I just, on behalf of all of them and just directly from me as your friend and as a colleague for many years now, I just want to say thank you for the incredible work you're doing and for sharing it with us. Thank you so much. And actually now thinking about all of this, and you said I should write a book, I should write a book and call it the Tripartite Model.",
        "CGjdgy0cwGk_150": "And they did that over a period of six months. And we know that when you take creatine over and over day to day, that there's a buildup of creatine stores, both in the muscles and within the brain tissue. And what they found as a consequence of this creatine administration was really striking and I think quite exciting. They found a very significant decrease in the frequency of headache in people that were supplementing with creatine as opposed to the controls. Now keep in mind that this is a pilot study, but the effects are very dramatic.",
        "juD99_sPWGU_34": "Remember, they have to be finished through aerobic metabolism. So even if you're lifting weights and you're using carbs for your fuel, you have got to finish that metabolism by running it into the mitochondria and performing oxidative metabolism. As a result of that, that electron transport chain runs. So theoretically, if free radicals, which are hyperreactive oxygen species, basically they're oxygen molecules that are missing electrons so that they react to a lot of things. They're the opposite of antioxidants, by the way. This is the oxygen molecules with extra protons so they can balance the charge.",
        "ccrbE0QHy94_5": "It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized. I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for almost three years now, and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep. So much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my Eight Sleep, I very much look forward to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my Eight Sleep mattress cover.",
        "9tRohh0gErM_228": "And I have to say the data on this are somewhat mixed. There is evidence that when people ingest artificial sweeteners, that it can create a transient increase in blood glucose, followed by a transient decrease in blood glucose below baseline. This is thought to explain the increase in hunger caused by ingestion of things like aspartame and sucralose and things of that sort. There are not a lot of good studies exploring the plant-based non-sugar sweeteners, things like stevia, even things like monk fruit, which is a separate category into itself. There aren't a lot of studies on this.",
        "gXvuJu1kt48_99": "This can lead to increases in mood or increases in the likelihood that someone will talk a certain way or behave a certain way or feel a certain way. They can also lead to decreases in synaptic transmission, that is communication between neurons in ways that will make somebody's mood lower or will make them less hungry or more hungry. And here's the really key thing. There are two kinds of endogenous cannabinoid receptors referred to as CB1 and CB2. And we can say with confidence that CB1 is highly enriched in the nervous system and especially within the brain."
