And then I definitely do not, especially because you get parents that want to see their... There was a kid that I went to middle school and high school with. Now, I don't know him well enough to, I would certainly not say his name in case I'm wrong about this, but what I heard was that he was on steroids. Now, when I say this kid had density of muscle at 12, I'm talking it was unreal. And that always worried me that if that was true, that that was pressure from his parents and wasn't... I just can't fathom, at 12, how do you even get steroids? But he was a freak. And he was, I think he was like five, eight, and he could high jump seven feet. It was unreal.",

And to me, this is a world is flat moment, that the people who've learned to game the system, that this discomfort that we feel, we actually are right. They actually don't understand the game they're in. Business is an infinite game. And when you play with a finite mindset, lots of people suffer, including the companies that they themselves are trying to build. That's the great irony. The great irony is the way you build great companies is with an infinite mindset. The way you build great companies is by prioritizing people before profit. The way you build great companies is will before resources. Both things important, but there has to be this general leaning, where we can feel, when we come to work and feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves, where we feel that our work and our effort is worth more than simply the money we make. We know that. Right? I'm a fan. And so for me, I got tired of being told I was naive.",

That's one of the considerations that are being faced today. But the main thing to know about this, stepping back for the big picture, is that every individual, every company and every government has a certain amount of money that comes in in the form of income, a certain amount of expenses that and then a certain amount of savings. So you do individually and every all your listeners do. And it works the same way for everyone, so that if their income falls and then less to be less than their expenditures, they're in trouble unless they have a good savings and then they go to the savings. So all around the world, there are lots of entities that are in trouble in that way. So the government, the two parts of the government, the U.S. government, two parts, want to give checks to people. Now, it's difficult to decide who gets it, who doesn't get it. But if they don't give checks to people or to companies, those will go bankrupt because they may not have enough savings.",
        "GXoErccq0vw_32": "But also, system one is someone says something that hurts your ego, and you start defending yourself immediately. That's a negative of system one. That we would refer to as the mind. It's built up of conditioning. Those responses are conditioned. Those default elements are all there because of habit and continuous practice. The system two is more like the intelligence. What I would say is more like the parent. If you can consider system one to be more like a child, system two is more like a parent. It looks more at the long term. It looks more at the bigger picture. It processes that default reaction through a set of checking and metrics to decide whether that's true. The child is the one that wants everything right away, impatient, quickly responding, straight away reacting when it doesn't get what it wants. The intelligent parent, a good one, knows what the child wants and needs and what's better for it in the long term. Just starting there and being able to reflect and observe the different voices inside of us is a great place to start your self-awareness because the biggest challenge is that most of us don't know what we're listening to.",

You can put yourself into situations, create environments where you kind of train and develop those. Training and developing an attribute can't be done the same way as a skill.

But then as you get into the space that I'm in now, where you're sitting in front of a fucking camera and you're talking about who you are for real, then it's like, oh, God, we're getting into waters where this shit is not going to be popular, but it's fucking true. It's like when Russell Simmons says, every billionaire I know is depressed and miserable. Jay-Z is a very interesting example, because I'm looking at Jay-Z now, and Jay-Z has grown out his dreads and maybe wears these fancy bandanas around his head with the dreads, and I look at these pictures of Jay-Z, and I'm like, that's exactly how I wore my hair when I was in high school.",
        "JRPChBZ0Rjo_60": "And I'm like, no, that is a belief that you've chosen to believe and it's completely fucking you up. One of my favorite quotes, I think if there were to be a quote that would be on my tombstone, it's top three, which I love a lot of quotes. It's Orson Scott Card. He said, we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never think to question. And so it's because you truly believe it and those are the ones, those are the pesky ones. Those are the ones I think I was told, because you get asked a lot, I'm sure, like, hey, I'm going to talk to a mentor, what question should I ask them? And I got this really good one, which is, what do I believe to be true that isn't? Whoa. That's a great question. Right. And because I'm sure you see it and if I talk to somebody, I can tell, like, they cast these views of what is and what isn't about business, about marriage, about health, whatever it is.",

So that's why those are... This is so interesting. Right? This is why you're like, why the hell do some trees make this unbelievably sweet little thing that we can get out of it? Again, not all plants do all this. It's different. But you're getting the point, right? So polysaccharide in the bottom stored, convert it into disaccharides, move it up the tree, get it all the way to the end, convert that into monosaccharides, make that a sweet, delicious tasting thing that then other animals will come eat to spread our seeds, put it in their digestive tract, excrete it later throughout the forest, and get our seeds out there. Right? Fascinating. We do the same thing. We say store our starch, our glycogen, in our liver and our muscle. Keep the optimal amount in blood so that we can power brain activity and transport it back and forth where we want.",
        "4dgwXpoPLog_138": "I think at the foundation of this epidemic, whereby the year 2030, one in two people are going to be not just overweight but obese, are ultra-processed food products that by and large we over-consume today. Your average American today derives 60% of their calories from ultra-processed foods. These are the foods that line our supermarket aisles. Just to make it really simple for the audience, our supermarkets tend to be designed the same way. It's the perishable fresh food that tend to be around the perimeter. The aisles have all the shelf-stable convenience foods that are minimally satiating, highly calorically dense, and hyper-palatable. Those three factors make those kinds of foods, particularly when they're all you have access to, a recipe for disaster. It's driving disease, I think, in a major way. When it comes to the kinds of things that people should learn how to identify and thus avoid, I think we have to all be more mindful of the added sugar epidemic. Added sugar is insidious today. It's in everything. It's in sauces. It's in coffee beverages.",
        "Zwkk4NyO3GA_55": "But one of the things you learn as you study the history is that they were human. They had hopes and dreams, just like you and I. They had doubts, too. Right. And the minute you figure that out, you then understand that actually nothing separates them from you, but for the fact that you're waiting for someone like them to show up. And so the question I always ask is, so if we're all waiting for the messiah. Who is it? Because we can't all wait. Somebody has to step up. And then the recognition that actually, if you read history, communities generally save themselves. Right. There's no single person that does it. So we talk about Nelson Mandela. But the truth is, Nelson Mandela led a collective of people who fought for the liberation of my country. Right. He was he was the halo. Right. That was evangelized so we could create a single narrative about freeing black people in South Africa. But actually, there were millions like him who made others even an ultimate sacrifice with their lives. Right. And so once you start realizing that you go, oh, but hold on.",

I have too many examples of friends, and family, and just people I don't know, which are just friends of my mind, that have superseded much more difficult situations than I have. The other thing it's helped me to do is really focus on the rituals, and the routines, the habits, the abilities that really matter, the 80-20 rule, because when I have a certain amount of energy, I can only do a certain amount of things, and I need to get more back. I'm still doing the job, quote-unquote, of most three or four people, going on stage and traveling to the kind of things that we do, but it forces me to focus on the things that's going to give maximum return. I think we do teach the things that we need to learn the most. I think the best teachers are the best students, and I know I'm going through this. I had surgery recently to correct this.",

That's a that's a great team in our case. You know, for me, I was the thing that really helped me. I was learning how to sacrifice for some things. Of course, I was known as a scorer. I wanted to score a lot of points. I wanted to get a lot of rebounds. And with that comes a lot of notoriety. But eventually I had to understand that, OK, these two guys are really good, too. And if we're top five or 10 players in the world, they're enough, perhaps. And I had to realize that and understand that. And you know what?",

So, um, so 13 to 14, right when I was going into puberty, my dad was, my stepdad was a Vietnam vet and was lived, we ran, he ran a very military household as it related to me, the stepson. So part of me was always prepared to go into the military. Cause my dad told me, right, you're out of the house at 18. You're either going into the military or you're getting a job. You're not going to college cause we don't have any money for you to go to college. So that was always my rubric, right? I'm going to get a job and I'm, or I'm going to go into the military, but I don't have a home. April 18th, the day after I turned 18, I no longer have a home. And my dad made it very clear. Like this is how it's going to work. Were you still in high school? I was my senior year, 18, 18. I was going to, I was going to graduate in May and April was my birthday.",

What is something I can smell right now? What am I feeling right now? And like just coming back home. I mean, it's a practice a lot of people do when anxiety rises up where it's like started listing, like, where am I and am I safe and am I good? But for me, it's really just like taking that deep breath. Today is getting my hair blow dried. I was on my phone kind of doing all these things. I was like, be here right now. You don't have to be efficient all the time. You don't have to be doing something or creating something. And so for me, it can look anywhere. But it's like taking that deep breath, realizing I haven't been breathing deep enough and then relaxing into that. All right. So what I want to talk about efficiency really fast, super self-indulgent way. And I want to get back to like how people then listen.",

An awareness of how to move through the world, how to become independent, how to create your own label, how to be a touring artist, not worrying so much about going viral, and to make a pretty extraordinary living, to not have a boss. I mean, there's just a whole lot of incredible things that go along with that. And the first moment in your story where I saw, okay, this is a guy with self-awareness who is making moves, meaning there's cognition behind the choices that he's doing. So ninth grade, you get bounced out of school for basically fucking around, as far as I can tell. You find hip hop. You go all in. You're not really worried about school. Your parents send you to a boarding school. And I think the sort of typical narrative in that is, well, get bounced out of boarding school as well, but you don't.",

Step three, take a look at what the thinking is. Step four, play around with or be willing to be open to the fact that if it's moving you into a primal state, it may not be true. Step five would be if that's not true, then some form of the opposite must be true. What might that be? Step six would be, well, what evidence do you have for the fact that that would be true? What happens over time is the brain starts to even get acclimated to this process. I don't go through the six step process every time, right? I notice I have an emotional reaction and I reorient myself fairly quickly. Like I said, I'm a human being so I get hooked on things that are triggers for me all the time. I just don't get hooked as frequently and I don't spend as much time in the hook. No, that's super powerful. Where can people learn more about you? People can go to our website at DavidBayer.com.",

When you were two years old, you use your gut feeling to start conjugating verbs? No, you learn from other people. You learn manners, you learn language, you learn all things valuable. You learn to drive from another person, so doesn't it make sense? You learn life. So books are just the mentors who maybe are dead now. You want to learn about Steve Jobs? He ain't alive to teach you, but you can learn through accumulated wisdom. And that's what, trust me, I meet very few powerful businessmen I've ever met. Don't read a lot. Warren Buffett, who I think is the best businessman by far in the world. He has 75 companies that he pretty much runs, 200 billion in revenue. He reads eight hours a day. He reads 600. He said he slowed down in his old age. He only reads 500 pages a day. Bill Gates goes on reading vacations."
