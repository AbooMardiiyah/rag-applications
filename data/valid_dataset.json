And she goes, because if I did, everybody would instantly judge me and conclude that I'm only here for whatever reason. But more importantly, I'm ruining it for everyone that comes after me.",

I was just thinking about you I got back from China today, and I just wanted you to know that I totally love you and appreciate you I live this extraordinary life, and I'm so grateful You know I'm one of six and all the things then I work through it and say to myself Why do I still feel this way?

And so I've heard you say a lot that like, my goal is to get people to do two or three days a week and they'll sustain it. I really have a hard time with that. I know, you know why you have a hard time with that? How many Tom Bilyeus do you think exists in the world or people like you? You are literally one in a million. So those messages that you hear, the beast mode and aspire, and they resonate with you because that's who you are. There's two ways to do this sustainably, okay? There's two ways. One, which is extremely rare, which you fall into is the epiphany. This is the moment, that's it. That light switch. And it could be anything. It could be trauma. It could be, you just decided it could be an event. Someone had a heart attack. My friend died from cancer. Sometimes you see this and they're just like, that's it.",

        "e1414c71-1c64-4cba-9be3-f9bf0a5f8453": "And I think the reason why many of those clinical trials failed is because they didn't quite understand that you do need the beta adrenergic receptor occupied by norepinephrine when you are learning something new, like the context of safety. But it's during sleep that you need the beta receptors to be not occupied by norepinephrine anymore, so that you can do the loosening that's required for reassociating and recontextualizing something. So you need to give them at the right time, I think. And enough. Other clinical trials, I think, failed because they gave too low of a dose, and it didn't occupy enough, or didn't block enough of the beta receptors in the brain. And have you looked at the research on psychedelics and trauma therapy? I have, it's really fascinating. And the thing about psychedelics, many of them actually activate the serotonergic system, and we don't even know which specific receptors. Serotonin is another, noradrenaline is one neurotransmitter system, serotonin is a different one that is also on whenever we're learning.",

Before CDC got their environmental chemistry lab up and running to the point that they could cheaply measure these things in small amounts of sample in lots of people, it really wasn't known what the exposure was to phthalates, to phenols, to parabens, and on and on and on and on, right? And so John did that. He was a chemist, he measured that, and he saw that phthalates were in everybody, everybody in the United States at, I mean, almost 99%, regardless of age or sex or race or whatever. So there you have it. It was in everybody. What does it do? Turn over to this other laboratory, National Toxicology Program, and their job was to take these chemicals that were known to be in everybody and say, what do they do? And they do that with animals, because that's where you start.",

That's always been my throwaway to just be like, there's an environmental thing that's happening here. We have so much plastic building up in our bodies and tissues and the things we eat. But I had no idea what the mechanism would be. That is fascinating. So the under-masculinization of men due to phthalates. If you had to guess, what percentage of the under-masculinization problem is phthalates? Are there like, is it 20%? There's 80% that we haven't discovered? Or is this really like, no, no, no, it's always elevated. I mean, I guess even that's correlation, not causation. I'll let you answer the question. Swag me a percentage. I'm not going to do that because I'm going to, wait, because I'm going to say this isn't the only chemical in the book. True, true.",

I think that's a huge flaw. I think we just get great at what we're good at. We only need to be good at one or two things and we can make an impact on the world. Tom Bilyeu, how do people find those things? Well, I've been doing it for so long time that I think the best way, as archaic as this might sound, is I literally will jot down now and I'll tell people whether I'm in a high-end mastermind where people paid 100 grand to be in a room or they paid 90 bucks to be in a room. I'll tell the same people is take a journal, do it in your phone in the notes or do it in your journal or on a pad, and write down the stuff you do on a daily basis, hour by hour, and then go through it and literally look at the stuff as simple as it sounds.",

But all of his biomarkers improved, very healthy, lived very long afterwards. And that just shocked me. Morbidly obese, most folks couldn't do that. But most humans can go weeks and actually be relatively... I think Mr. Beast did a video where he did like 16 days or something. He was aiming for like 28 or something and tapped out? Yeah. I did like 16. Yeah. But that just... It was radical to me. And I'll say that just psychologically, I didn't feel hunger. I felt addiction withdrawals. Interesting. I felt addiction withdrawals.",

And one of the bones of the forearm kind of slips out of it's a ring of tendon that it's lying in. And the child will not move the arm, will not do anything with the arm, no matter what. And this is very simple. It's one of the most satisfying things in all of medicine. You just take the kid's arm and sort of turn it. You feel a click. The kid's crying and screaming. And the parent's like, oh my God, they're worse. What happened? And then you, but I go out of the room for 20 minutes and come back and the kid is 100% normal using the arm. You know, we'll hold the popsicle up and they'll reach with both arms and we're like, see, they're fine.

By 2050, China is going to have 650 million people. Oh my God. There's 1.2 billion in it now. China and Japan and South Korea have the worst imbalances with regards to this, the worst birth rates. Japan's 125 million people at the moment. It's going to be 60, 65 billion people by 2050. Whoa. Whoa. So this is not just going to be something that creeps up on us.

All right. All right, guys, I'm telling you, the coming AI revolution is so massive, and to let it catch you off guard would really be a tragedy, largely for the reason that he already talked about, which is there is this real fear of loss of meaning coming, because everybody has their identity so tied up in their job.",

That what history has shown us is that when things get difficult, people get stressed and they get, they can get angry and they could all fight with each other. And that produces the next leg of a terrible economy because the economy won't work efficiently if people are fighting with each other, the system doesn't work well. So one would have to say, you know, who's going to bring the country together behind sensible I would say bipartisan programs, because if you don't have that, then you have a form of revolution and you don't have good management. And that's the greatest risk I would say politically. So looking at the historical perspective, who has done this well and then what have been the stakes that have led to literal revolution? When you say who has done it well, what do you mean?",

They want to say that if you guide adaptive behavior, you're going to see the truth. So, so I decided with my colleagues, Chetan Prakash and Manish Singh and Robert Prentner and others, um, my, some graduate students, Justin Mark and Brian Marion, um, to, to test this. Um, you know, evolution is a mathematically precise theory. We have evolutionary game theory. So there's a technical question. What is the probability that, um, evolution, but natural selection would shape any sensory system to see truths about objective reality, the structure of objective reality?

David, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me on. I'm psyched. Dude, I am so excited. I encountered your book Feeling Good about 18 months ago and have since that point been desperate to get you on the show. I think it's one of the most profound books. If somebody is struggling with anxiety, depression, any sort of mood disorder, and so when you released the new book, Feeling Great, it was the perfect opportunity to get you on. I think the two books together are really the most, certainly the most effective thing I have ever encountered. I think cognitive behavioral therapy in general is just beyond extraordinary. If I do my job well, because I know you have the information, if I do my job well, by the end of this, somebody that's struggling with a mood disorder I think will move forward pretty profoundly. If you don't mind, let's start with the basics. What is cognitive behavioral therapy and why do you think that it works as rapidly as it does?",

That wasn't part of the emotionally hard part of starting is seeing people start to make money, even though it hadn't cracked and become what we think of today. But I imagine that wouldn't be too easy as you're struggling to get this thing off the ground. You're struggling to make ends meet. People are writing to you telling you you're destroying America when none of this is for money. What advice do you have for somebody that's in the middle of that path and they're looking at somebody that took the more traditional path? It's easier. Maybe they've had kids and they can support the family. What would you tell them to hold on to? It was so hard. At one point, my best friend who works in finance took a month off between jobs and moved out to San Francisco just to be near me because I think he was so worried. This was in my low point, in my 20s, that depression I referred to. For me, what really helped was, again, going back to the stories of the people we were helping because it just provided this sustenance."
