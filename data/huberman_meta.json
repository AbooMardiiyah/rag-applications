We address the \u201ccalories in- calories out\u201d (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-lustig-how-sugar-processed-foods-impact-your-health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Robert Lustig\nWebsite: https://robertlustig.com \nBooks: https://robertlustig.com/books\nPublications: https://robertlustig.com/publications\nBlog: https://robertlustig.com/blog\nUCSF academic profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robert.lustig \nMetabolical (book): https://amzn.to/48mNhOE\nSugarScience: http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu \nX: https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrRobertLustig\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-lustig-8904245 \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/robertlustigmd \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@robertlustigmd \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robert Lustig\n00:02:02 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & AeroPress\n00:06:41 Calories, Fiber\n00:12:15 Calories, Protein & Fat, Trans Fats\n00:18:23 Carbohydrate Calories, Glucose vs. Fructose, Fruit, Processed Foods\n00:26:43 Fructose, Mitochondria & Metabolic Health\n00:31:54 Trans Fats;
