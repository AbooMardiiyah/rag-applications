            "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System Function,\" Andrew Huberman discusses the importance of cortisol and adrenaline in regulating energy levels and immune system function. He emphasizes the benefits of optimizing cortisol release through morning sunlight exposure and leveraging short-term stress to boost immunity and learning. The podcast covers strategies for increasing energy and immune response, such as cold exposure, intense exercise, and specific breathing techniques. Huberman also explores the negative effects of chronic stress on health, including disrupted sleep and increased anxiety, and discusses the biological mechanisms behind cravings for comfort foods during stress. He provides actionable advice on how to regulate stress hormones and improve overall well-being.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: I should just remind you that most of the negative effects on your life and on the lives of others are due to people, perhaps you, I hope not, being unable to regulate their mind when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body, either because they read something in a text or a comment section. Of course, that never happens to me, but it may happen to you. Of course, it happens to me. But the idea is to stay calm in your mind so that then you can regulate your action, right? And so I think that there are these practices that one can develop over time that are really straightforward and zero cost, right? You could find any number of ways to increase your adrenaline and stay calm. And we tend to focus on things like exercise as the way that we get our energy up. But today, again, I'm talking about deliberately increasing adrenaline while staying calm mentally, because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events, through things that we didn't seek out. So the ability to regulate adrenaline and cortisol is about inducing them deliberately when you want to push back on infection, potential infection from bacteria or viruses.\n------------------------\n",

So they're going to bias you towards more stress in other domains. Remember, cortisol can cross the blood brain barrier. So you're going to be more prone to psychological stress. I also want to mention again again that I think there's great benefit to having a practice that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can't, maybe every third day or every other day of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind so that you learn to separate the brain body experience. You know, we hear so much about how beneficial it is to unify the brain and body that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies. I particularly dislike claims like that or statements like that, because there's great power as we learned today in having your body activated by some sort of stimulus, cold water, or even psychological stress, but learning to stay calm in your mind.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety,\" Andrew Huberman delves into the science behind stress and emotions, exploring how to understand, manage, and leverage stress for health benefits. He explains the biology of stress, debunking myths and highlighting its role in aligning our internal state with external experiences. Huberman discusses the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, their functions, and how they can be harnessed through breathing techniques like the physiological sigh to regulate stress responses in real-time.\n\nHe also addresses the positive aspects of acute stress, such as its capacity to enhance focus and immune function, and introduces breathing exercises that can induce a beneficial stress response to combat infection. Huberman emphasizes the importance of managing medium-term stress by increasing our stress threshold through practices that dissociate the mind's calmness from the body's heightened state.\n\nFor long-term stress, he underscores the significance of social connection and its relationship with neuromodulators like serotonin, which can foster feelings of well-being\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: A lot of stress inoculation, a lot of managing medium term stress on the timescale of weeks, or maybe even a couple months. So we're not talking about years of stress. A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold. It's about capacity. And there are very simple tools, excellent tools that will allow us to modulate our capacity for stress. And they look a lot like the tools I just described. They involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat, not to the extreme, and then when we feel flooded with adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally, calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body. So unlike trying to unify the mind and body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I actually do as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological size in real time. You can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection if you're feeling kind of run down.\n------------------------\n"

Huberman explores both pharmaceutical and natural remedies, emphasizing that many natural treatments can be as effective, if not more so, than drugs, without the side effects. He also debunks the misconception that natural treatments are not scientifically grounded, explaining that they are based on a solid understanding of headache mechanisms.

In particular, they can be sedative. Many of them can be habit forming or even addictive. And for many people, not all, but many people, they don't want to take drugs, whether or not they're over the counter or prescription drugs or even more natural supplement based type treatments. And they would rather use, for instance, a behavioral approach in which they can modulate, they can deliberately turn off the communication between sensory neurons and motor neurons. And it turns out those approaches exist as well. Okay, so at this point, I promise you that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology lesson in terms of pain sensing and headaches as a more conceptual phenomenon. Instead, what I'd like to do next is talk about the different types of headaches. And I think this is something that's very important and not often discussed, except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of headaches like migraine or cluster or tension headache.\n------------------------\n",

Would you want to make it such that you have the headache, but you don't perceive the headache? That is you cut off communication between the sensor and the motor so that the muscles relax. Turns out there are treatments and approaches for each and every one of those. Each and every one of those has different advantages and disadvantages. But as you can quickly see, we are going to have different types of headaches and different approaches to treating headache. But if you keep in the back of your mind that you have neurons that contract muscles to create movement or tension of muscles, remember you can turn off those neurons and allow those muscles to relax. You have sensory neurons that sense input and actually sense the pain. And you have modulatory neurons, which can allow you to adjust the relationship between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. And of course, some of you are probably screaming at me by now saying, wait, why would you ever want to deal with the motor neurons or the modulatory neurons? Wouldn't you want to just go straight to the source and just cut off the pain?\n------------------------\n",

So basically what I'm saying here is that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture and the maps of different insertion sites, we now know, or I should say people have long known and people in the West are starting to adopt the understanding that acupuncture, yes indeed, it really does work for relieving pain. And laboratories, both in the United States, which is Chufu's, and elsewhere are starting to find the underlying mechanisms. And those mechanisms include deactivation of the pain pathways, activation of some of the parallel pathways that assist in shutting down pain or in relaxing the muscles that are causing tension type headache, as well as activation of neural pathways that impinge on organs that then cause or reduce the release of molecules into the body that give us the experience of pain. So reduced inflammation, and in many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory pathways.\n------------------------\n"

Are you just thinking and allowing thoughts to enter and leave your system? Depends on the retreat. So sometimes I'm writing, but writing I think can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively productive. And I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well-being a lot of the time. So there are many areas in my life now. So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote The 4-Hour Body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being. Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be. Like where can I de-optimize selectively to sort of optimize the whole? Does that make sense? Makes good sense. Yeah.\n------------------------\n",

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Tim Ferriss. Tim Ferriss is an author, a podcaster, an investor, and is known for having a near-supernatural ability to predict the future, which has allowed him to obtain success in a huge number of different endeavors. For instance, he is a five-time number one New York Times bestselling author. But perhaps equally or more important to that, he's also exceptionally good at teaching people how to write, the entire process of writing and marketing a book. His books, The 4-Hour Chef and The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek, not only explain his own exploration of how to optimize and prioritize his time and learn particular skills, but he teaches you those skills as well. This is really what sets Tim apart. He is an exceptional learner and an exceptional teacher. And today you learn why that is, and in a characteristic Tim Ferriss way, he explains the process in a way that you can apply it.\n------------------------\n",

So are you, or were you at the time like waking up in the morning going, okay, I'm going to take a walk and think about the new, the old and the orphaned, or I'm going to take a walk or sit in a chair and think about like, what are the nerds doing right now? What are rich people doing right now? Cobbling together awkward solutions. Was that exploration a structured practice for you? Or is this just something that was the consequence of being Tim Ferriss waking up in the morning and just like leaning into that? Because I've experienced both, right? But I think a lot of us are curious. I mean, there's a lot of mystique around you. Whether you like it or not, it's there and we're not trying to pry, but is the establishment of structure for you something that's the consequence of structure in the first place?

This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process.

He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success can be useful at the outset of a goal and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal, but that it's not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal. Rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure and all the terrible things that it's going to bring seems to be more effective. And that maps very well to what's known about the neural circuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting your body and brain into a mode of activation, getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure that puts you into forward motion towards your goals is absolutely key. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. There were other things too, of course, the dopamine system and the power of subjective top-down control in regulating that dopamine system. But I want to be sure to include a tool that's been especially powerful for me, that's grounded in the neuroscience research and in the psychology research.\n------------------------\n",

Rather, if you are not feeling motivated, then what the scientific literature tells us is that you actually want to spend one to three, maybe five minutes visualizing failure, visualizing how terrible you will feel if you do not achieve your goal, visualizing severe consequences, perhaps mostly of the sort like telling yourself, gosh, I set a goal, I set a 12 week block, I quantify it, I know I want to do this, here I have the time to do it and I'm simply just not doing it.\n------------------------\n",

And in addition, I described this practice that one can incorporate as a daily or semi-daily practice of so-called space-time bridging, of using the visual system and your ability to deliberately step your visual system from stations that are within your body, so-called peripersonal or interoceptive space, out into the world further and further, and then back again in sequence as a way to harness and cultivate and build up these systems that link vision, space, time, reward systems, and so forth.\n------------------------\n"

And the general instruction is to start slow, to start with one or two, and then to find a level that you're comfortable with that doesn't create an excessive feeling of warmth in the stomach, that doesn't throw off your digestion. So it takes a little bit of experimentation. Again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider before exploring this, but this has become a very common practice for people with autoimmune disorders and accessing the gut because it is accessible by taking things has also become way in which people with various mental conditions are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing. Along these lines, I do want to mention that there are studies that show that people that supplement with a lot of probiotics or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog.\n------------------------\n",

Now, hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you. They literally can melt away skin. You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly. But hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form, in capsule or pill form. And there is a practice of starting to ingest one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal. And then what people will generally do is examine to see whether or not that improves their symptoms of indigestion, how it relates to mood, how it relates to wellbeing, how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera. By changing the acidity, you also change the way that the gut communicates with the brain through the mechanisms we talked about before. And there are a growing number of people embracing these practices of taking HCL. It's often combined with other things. It's usually combined with an enzyme, and that enzyme is pepsin.\n------------------------\n",

They explore a comprehensive range of topics related to male hormone health across all ages, including the impact of hormones on mood, libido, wellbeing, strength, cognition, and psychological factors. Dr. Gillett provides specific recommendations for hormone optimization tailored to different goals and life stages, discussing how to assess whether hormone levels are optimized and how often to test for them. They delve into the importance of behavioral foundations for optimal hormone function and the necessity of avoiding certain activities that could negatively affect hormone levels.

Only if their homocysteine is persistently elevated. And homocysteine is kind of like an inflammatory marker that can build up if you're not converting enough of it downstream. How would I know? Just a blood test. Or if you knew your MTHFR polymorphism, which is basically how you add methyl groups to many things in the body. Great. Any side effects of betaine that people should be aware of? Not that I know of. Okay. People can look it up on examine.com is a great site for that. They'll surely list it. They just revamped their site, by the way, and it was awesome before and it's platinum now. So L-carnitine, what are the ways to take L-carnitine?

            "\nShow Summary: In this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the comprehensive effects of alcohol on the body, brain, and overall health. He explains that alcohol is consumed by humans and animals primarily because of the pleasurable effects it can induce. The episode delves into the impact of alcohol at cellular, organ, and systemic levels, including its influence on behavior and cognition when inebriated. Huberman addresses common questions about the health implications of low to moderate drinking compared to abstinence or heavy consumption. He also discusses strategies to mitigate hangover effects and the genetic differences that influence alcohol metabolism and the risk of developing alcoholism. The episode emphasizes that while alcohol can temporarily alleviate stress and elevate mood, chronic intake\u2014even at low levels\u2014can lead to increased baseline stress, reduced mood, and changes in neural circuits that may encourage further drinking. Huberman clarifies that the podcast provides information without judgment, aiming to empower informed decisions about alcohol consumption.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And we've been talking about some of those effects, effects like reducing the amount of stress. I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say, oh, I need a drink and then they have a drink and they're like, calm down. Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work. They can start to think about things in a maybe more grounded or rational way, or at least they believe that, or they can somehow just relax themselves. Well, while that very well may be true, that it can relax them, when they are not drinking, that level of cortisol that's released at baseline has increased substantially. Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit between brain and body, and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol to some of the other hormones involved in the stress response. We'll provide a reference to the study that describes how all of this works for those of you that really want to delve into it. But let's go back to this issue of those who are prone to alcoholism versus those who are not. Remember, there are people who have genetic variants that meaning genes that they inherited their parents, that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.\n------------------------\n",

Well, those people experience changes in their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis that result in more cortisol, more of this so-called stress hormone being released at baseline when they are not drinking. This is really important. People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit, I don't mean one or two sips or even a glass of wine every once in a while. I mean, again, people that are maybe having one drink a night with dinner and maybe on the weekend, a few more. Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns to explain how it could also be two or three drinks on Friday or six drinks only on Saturday. Well, all of those groups experience increases in cortisol release from their adrenal glands when they are not drinking. And as a consequence, they feel more stressed and more anxiety when they aren't drinking.

He explains the importance of understanding fertility for everyone, not just those looking to conceive, as it relates to overall vitality and longevity. Huberman delves into the menstrual cycle in females, describing its orchestration for potential fertilization and its impact on brain and body behavior. For males, he discusses spermatogenesis and the journey sperm take to reach and fertilize the egg. The episode also covers actionable tools for enhancing fertility, including behavioral changes, nutrition, supplementation, and medical interventions for hormone or neurotransmitter production issues. Huberman emphasizes that knowledge of fertility processes can contribute to maximizing health and lifespan, regardless of one's desire to have children.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So you can just go to hubermanlab.com, put into the search function, stress tools, and a bunch of different links will pop up related to those topics. Likewise with sleep, likewise with any number of different topics you might be interested in. So get enough quality sleep and thereby reduce stress and also directly buffer stress with real-time tools to buffer stress that I've talked about in the episodes that you can access. And there are ways to greatly reduce your overall level of stress to limit any cortisol that's released early in the day, which is when you want cortisol released and not have it late in the day and so on and so forth. So reduce your stress. And as I just told you, by all means, do not drink more than two drinks per week and zero is better than two. If anyone tells you, oh, well, there's, you know, all this resveratrol in red wine and that's good for us, the data simply tell us that there's not enough resveratrol in red wine to really have any positive health benefit. The data around resveratrol and health benefits itself is under question nowadays. Zero alcohol is better than any alcohol.\n------------------------\n"

Although commonly associated with blood pressure, sodium plays a broader role in health and performance, including athletic and cognitive functions, aging, and dementia. Huberman explores how the brain regulates our salt appetite and aversion, and how the perception of saltiness can influence sugar cravings and consumption. He presents the idea that for some, more salt might enhance health and functioning, while for others, less is beneficial. Huberman emphasizes consulting with a physician before altering salt intake and outlines the neurobiology and hormonal biology involved in salt regulation, touching on liver and kidney function as well as brain function.

Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required. Dr. Balcetis discusses the importance of not only setting goals but also planning for obstacles and creating actionable steps to overcome them.

            "\nShow Summary: In episode 47 of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the science of gratitude and its profound impact on mental and physical health. He debunks the common misconception that an effective gratitude practice merely involves listing things one is thankful for. Instead, he highlights neuroimaging and physiological data that suggest a different approach is necessary. Huberman emphasizes that receiving gratitude can significantly activate neural circuits associated with health benefits. He also explores the concept of \"theory of mind\" and its relation to pro-social behaviors. The episode delves into how narrative stories of gratitude can synchronize physiological responses, such as heart rate, among listeners. Huberman also explains how gratitude practices can reshape neural circuits, reducing anxiety and increasing motivation. Additionally, he touches on neurochemical aspects, specifically serotonin's role in enhancing pro-social behaviors and how certain supplements might influence gratitude practices. Lastly, Huberman suggests a practical gratitude practice framework, including frequency and timing, to harness these benefits.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Taking a substance that increases a neurochemical in your brain will likely, provided it's the right substance and it's the right practice, will likely enhance the amplitude or the intensity of that practice and make it a more potent form of inducing neuroplasticity, meaning it will create longer lasting or more robust brain changes than if one hadn't increased their chemistry in this way, this way of taking something. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you couldn't get to the very same place without it by simply doing a slightly longer gratitude practice or putting a little bit more mental effort into it. That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity really resides in not just one approach, not just neurochemistry and taking substances to increase neuroplasticity, not just behavioral practices to try and increase neuroplasticity, not just brain machine interfaces or devices to increase neuroplasticity, but rather the convergence of multiple tools. So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, as we say in the brain, using something like KANA combined with a gratitude practice in the not too distant future. This will probably also be combined with some sort of non-invasive device to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the episode titled \"Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind\" of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Karl Deisseroth, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Stanford School of Medicine. They discuss the groundbreaking work of Dr. Deisseroth's lab in developing optogenetics, a technique using light to control neurons, which has transformative potential for understanding and treating psychiatric disorders. They explore the implications of this technology for conditions like depression, OCD, autism, and blindness. Additionally, they delve into the future of psychiatric treatment, the challenges of specificity in medication, and the potential for non-invasive treatments informed by optogenetic research. Dr. Deisseroth also shares insights on the art and science of psychiatry, the importance of understanding patients' experiences, and the potential for brain-machine interfaces in mental health treatment.\nShow Guest: Dr. Karl Deisseroth\nTranscript: Are these opening up new paths or representations of paths into the future? MDMA, ecstasy, is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. And I realize that the neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin often work in concert, not alone, the way they're commonly described in the more general popular discussions. However, it is a unique compound and it's different than the serotonergic compounds like LSD and psilocybin. And there are now data still emerging that it might be, and in some cases can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and similar things. Why would that work? And a larger question, perhaps the more important question is psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds, in my mind, there are two components. There's the experience you have while you're on them. And then there's the effect they have after. People are generating variations of these compounds that are non-hallucinatory variations.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, there are forms of pharmacology that can shift brain neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in ways that favor creativity. And this is certainly a topic that we will go into in more depth in a future episode, but there's an exciting study that was performed just this last year, looking at the role of serotonin, another neuromodulator, in divergent and convergent thinking. And it turns out that serotonin underlies a lot of the brain activity that's responsible for both divergent and for convergent thinking. And there's one particular form of pharmacology, which can enhance activation of the serotonergic pathways associated with the so-called 5-HT, that's serotonin, 5-HT, that's the abbreviation, 5-HT2A receptor, serotonin 2A receptor in particular brain areas in ways that favor both divergent and convergent thinking. And the pharmacologic agent in that case turns out to be very low dose, or as some of you may have heard of it referred to as micro dosing of psilocybin.\n------------------------\n"

There is this idea, and I'll say it so that you don't have to, that dates back to Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution, very controversial, right? And maybe not even controversial. I think it's very like offensive even to certain people. This idea of inheritance of acquired traits, the idea that one could change themselves through some activity, use the example of going to the gym. We could also use the example of somebody who becomes an endurance runner, then decides to have children within another endurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this running and not just because they were biased towards running in the first place, but because of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners. Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong. So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits? What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion? Right.

Dr. Rech\nShow Guest: Dr. Oded Rechavi\nTranscript: How specific can it be? Does it make sense for it to be specific? And in the case of C. elegans, the response can be very specific through this inheritance of RNAs, which are just sequence specific. They downregulate, they control one particular gene. In other cases, it could be a very general response. And it's very interesting to think about it when we talk about inheritance of memories, which is the most interesting thing we could imagine. Can brain activity of some sort transmit, at least in these worms? I said, Noah, I said this disclaimer multiple times in members we don't know, times will tell. In worms we know a lot. So can worms transmit brain activity to, do they have the specificity to do it? Okay. Before I'll say that, I'll just say that we over the years learned a lot about the mechanisms that shuttle the RNAs between generations. We know about genes that are needed just for that. About worms, it would be perfectly okay, but just don't have the capacity to transfer the RNAs to the next generations.

There are other languages that have very, very few. For example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian has an inventory of about 12 to 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants and vowels. English, on contrast, has about 40 different consonants and vowels. So languages have different inventories. They can overlap for sure, but different languages use different sound elements, combine and recombine those elements to give rise to different words and meanings. Can we say that there is a most complicated language out there or among the most complicated, would it be Russian? It's definitely high up there. English is up there too, actually. Yeah, German as well. And in terms of learning multiple languages during development, my understanding is that if one wants to become bilingual or trilingual, best to learn those languages simultaneously during development, ideally before age 12, if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later. Is that correct? Or do you want to revise that? Well, basically the earlier and the earlier is better, the more intense it is and the more immersive it is.\n------------------------\n",

And one point I want to make about it is this, is that in English, for example, there are about 40 different phonemes. Phonemes are just consonants or vowels or individual speech segments. But these articulatory features that you refer to, for example, the characteristic sounds that are generated by specific movements in the mouth, you can more or less reduce that to about 12 different features. Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue, the jaw, the lips, the larynx. There are about 12 of these movements. And just like you said, Andrew, by themselves, they have no meaning. They're just movements. But what's incredible about it is that you take these 12 movements and you put them in combinations and you start putting them in sequence. We as humans use those 12 set of features to generate all words. And because we can generate nearly an infinite number of words with that code of just 12 features, we have something that generates essentially all possible meaning. Because that's what we do as humans. We generate meanings.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode 87 of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Erich Jarvis, a neurobiologist exploring the complexities of vocal learning, speech, and language. Dr. Jarvis's work investigates the genetic and neural underpinnings of how species like humans, songbirds, and parrots acquire and produce language, including the ability to learn and articulate complex vocalizations. They discuss the intricate relationship between speech, language, and movement, such as dance, and how these elements are intertwined both biologically and cognitively. They also delve into the idea that reading engages sub-perceptual motor activity in the throat, reflecting internalized speech. The conversation covers the potential evolutionary pathway from innate vocalizations to learned speech and the concept of critical periods for language acquisition. Dr. Jarvis's research suggests that the brain regions associated with speech production may have evolved from those involved in controlling body movement, leading to the unique human capacity for sophisticated language and even the ability to dance\nShow Guest: Dr. Erich Jarvis\nTranscript: And so you narrow down the ones you use to string the phonemes together in the words that you learn, and you maintain those phonemes as an adult. And here comes along another language that's using those phonemes or in different combinations you're not used to. And therefore, it's like starting from first principles. But if you already have them in multiple languages that you're using, then it makes it easier to use them in another third or fourth language. I see. Incredible. So it's not like your brain has maintained greater plasticity. It's your brain has maintained greater ability to produce different sounds that then allows you to learn another language faster. Got it. Are the hand gestures associated with sounds or with meanings of words? I think the hand gestures are associated with both the sounds and the meaning. When I say sound, like if you are really angry, right, and you are making a loud screaming noise, right, you may make hand gestures that look like you're going to beat the wall, right? Because you're making loud sounds and loud gestures, all right?\n------------------------\n"

So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over.

However, when it comes to learning and improving performance in the cognitive or physical domain, they are not equivalent. So this is the second principle of mental training and visualization. As you recall, the first principle of mental training and visualization was that in order to make it effective, it needs to be very brief and very simple and repeated over and over again. The second principle of mental training and visualization is that while yes, mental training and visualization recaptures the same patterns of neural firing in the exact same ways as real world behavior and thinking, it is not as effective as real world behavior and thinking. In other words, if you want to learn something, the ideal situation is to combine real training in the physical world with mental training. And I'll talk about exactly how to do that and in what ratios a little bit later.\n------------------------\n",

And in doing so, we can really stamp down a third principle of mental training and visualization, which is that your mental training and visualization will be far more effective if you are performing the exact same or very similar mental and physical tasks in the real world. Okay, so first principle is mental training and visualization needs to be simple and brief and repeated. Second is that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world motor training or cognitive training. It's an augment. It's an addition that can really help. And the third principle of mental training and visualization is that you need to combine mental training and visualization with real world behaviors and experiences that are very, very similar. Now as a brief, but I think really relevant aside, one of the things that also makes mental training and visualization more effective is when we assign cognitive labels to what's going on when we visualize.\n------------------------\n"

Do a task in the real world, do 50 trials of the imagined task, do the trial in the real world again. Significant improvement in speed and accuracy through now what are becoming to be established neural circuit connections between cerebellum and primary motor cortex. Okay, so this study is one of several, but not a tremendous number of studies out there that are starting to really pinpoint the underlying neural circuits that allow mental training and visualization to really improve motor skill performance. But again, and please hear me on this, in this study and in the vast majority of other studies that have shown significant improvement in motor performance in the real world by use of mental training and visualization, there was an ability of each and every one in the study to perform the specific motor sequence in the real world that then they were able to enhance with mental training and visualization. Now, thus far, we've been talking mostly about performance of motor sequences. And one of the things to really understand about performance of motor sequences, both in the real world and in the imagined context is that it involves the doing, that's what we call a go action and not doing certain things.\n------------------------\n",

What's been shown over and over again in this literature is that performing mental training and visualization repeatedly and in a very restricted way that makes it easier to perform those trials over and over and over again, and with a high degree of accuracy, almost always, really we can fairly say in essentially every study where it's been explored has led to improvements in real world performance of both cognitive and or physical tasks. So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over. So I don't want to overcomplicate or make it sound like mental training and visualization has to be performed in a very precise way or that it has to be done perfectly each and every time. Quite to the contrary.\n------------------------\n",

I misspoke in the sense that, again, I said, for the thing that you're trying to learn, remember mental training and visualization is going to be most effective for building up the number of accurate trials or your ability to do something with a greater frequency of something that you're already capable of doing or have done at least once in the real world. This is not to say that mental training and visualization can't be used to acquire new skills. It can in principle, but it has been shown to be most effective for enhancing the speed and the accuracy of skills that one has already demonstrated some degree of proficiency at in the real world. I think that's important to point out because we often hear mental training visualization and this equivalence of perceptual and motor experiences in our mind's eye to the real world.

So they are prone to concussions and head injuries simply by virtue of their work without any millions of dollars contracts or the opportunity to necessarily, in some cases they do, but necessarily to do other things. And certainly car accidents or bicycle accidents are not voluntary events. So the point being traumatic brain injury and headache related traumatic brain injury extends far beyond the realm of sports. And in fact, if you were to look at the numbers, what you find is that more than 90% of traumatic brain injury, so people coming into the hospital or clinic or people claiming that they've got consistent headaches, they're not sleeping well, their mood is off, they're feeling more irritable after having hit their head even once, is not the consequence of sports.

Keeping in mind, of course, that football is this very salient example of traumatic brain injury and concussion as is boxing, as is even soccer with heading of the ball, believe it or not, repeated low level impact to the forehead and other parts of the head can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion or being quote unquote knocked out. But sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion. Most traumatic brain injury and concussion and low level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living, that is lowered cognition, disruption in mood, sleep, et cetera, is actually the consequence of things other than sports. So for instance, bicycle accidents, playground accidents, construction accidents, and this is often forgotten. And for some reason, all the sports and in particular football tend to grab all the attention as it relates to concussion.\n------------------------\n",

Neuralink combines neuroscience, neurosurgery, robotics, machine learning, and novel devices to potentially treat diseases like Parkinson's and to augment human cognition and memory. Dr. MacDougall shares insights on brain function from a neurosurgeon's perspective, and the conversation explores the future of brain augmentation, including the use of peripheral devices like a radio receiver implanted in Dr. MacDougall's own body. The episode also touches on the potential of Neuralink's technology to enable quadriplegics to control digital devices and eventually reconnect their brains to their bodies.\nShow Guest: Dr. Matthew MacDougall\nTranscript: And it's not football and hockey. For some reason, football and hockey and boxing get all the attention. But my colleagues that work on traumatic brain injury tell me that most of the traumatic brain injury they see is somebody slips at a party and hits their head or is in a car accident or environmental accidents of various kinds. To my mind, most helmets don't actually cover this region close to the eyes. So is there also a failure of helmet engineering that, you know, I can understand why you'd want to have your peripheral vision out the sides of your eyes, periphery of your eyes, but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate, why isn't it being better protected? You know, I'm no expert in helmets, but I don't think we see a lot of epidural hematomas in sports injuries. To get this kind of injury, you usually need a really focal blunt trauma, like the baseball bat to the head is a classic mechanism of injury that would lead to a temporal bone fracture and epidural hematoma. With sports injuries, you know, you don't often see that, especially in football with, you know, a sharp, sharper object coming in contact with the head.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"Science-Supported Tools to Accelerate Your Fitness Goals,\" host Dr. Andrew Huberman and guest Dr. Andy Galpin discuss science-based strategies for enhancing fitness routines. The episode covers a wide range of protocols including how to structure a fitness regimen and integrate recovery, nutrition, and supplementary measures to augment strength, hypertrophy, endurance, anaerobic capacity, and more. Huberman highlights select protocols he has incorporated into his routine that are fun and time-efficient and encourages listeners to tailor these strategies to their goals without significantly increasing workout duration.\n\nKey components of any fitness program consist of a combination of cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. The episode emphasizes the necessity of including different training types (like zone two cardio, strength sessions, and different cardiovascular workouts) and recovery to make continuous progress.\n\nSpecific tools discussed include \"meshing\" zone two cardio with daily activities, like walking, to hit the recommended 200 minutes per week without additional scheduling.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Now, the one exception to this that I incorporated was that for very small muscle groups, so for instance, the rear deltoids, or for neck work, or for calf work, to not rely purely on three to five repetitions, but maybe to work in a range of anywhere from five to eight repetitions. So still fairly low repetitions, but not so low that it restricts you to three to five repetitions. The reason for that is that I, and I think a lot of people out there, find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately with good form when restricting oneself to those low repetitions. However, for big compound movements like presses and squats and deadlifts and glute ham raises and things of that sort, maybe even leg extensions and leg curls, which are isolation exercises, of course, to really restrict oneself to those three to five repetition ranges that take you to failure or near failure. I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced, and I'm confident that you will also experience a lot of benefits. So just to remind you what some of those benefits are, you get stronger, which feels great. That occurs within your weight workouts, but it also carries over to your endurance training sessions.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab guest series episode with Dr. Andy Galpin, they discuss the science and methods to increase strength, hypertrophy (muscle growth), and endurance. Dr. Galpin highlights the importance of strength and hypertrophy training for everyone, not just athletes, as it combats neuromuscular aging and preserves muscle function. He clarifies that strength training is essential for maintaining muscle power and strength, which is crucial for everyday movements and preventing falls as we age. The conversation also touches on the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training for cognitive function, immune health, and overall longevity. Dr. Galpin dispels misconceptions about strength training, emphasizing that it can be started at any age and is not solely for building muscle mass, but also for maintaining functional abilities. He also discusses the neuromuscular adaptations that occur with strength training, such as improved nerve firing, muscle contractility, and changes in muscle fiber type.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: But in reality, if it is, you can do whatever you would like. Tell me if this is a reasonable structure, given what you've told us. Three exercises per muscle group. First exercise, slightly heavier loads. So repetition ranges somewhere between, let's say, five and eight, with perhaps hitting failure or close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between two or let's, let's get wild and say five minutes. Okay. So it's a little bit more of a strength type workout at that point, but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition ranges now eight to 15, shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so. And then on the third exercise, repetition ranges of 12 to 30. This number 30 kind of makes me wide-eyed when I think about it. I can't remember the last time I did a set of 30 thinking it was for hypertrophy, but what you're saying makes absolute sense and is research-backed. So very short rest intervals, maybe 30 seconds between sets. Would that allow somebody to target all three forms of major adaptation? I mean, in my mind it works.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast #94 titled \"Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health,\" Andrew Huberman discusses science-based tools to optimize physical health, covering various fitness aspects such as endurance, strength, flexibility, hypertrophy, and more. He proposes a general fitness protocol that individuals can adapt to pursue specific fitness goals such as increased strength or endurance. Huberman outlines his workout schedule, emphasizing training large muscle groups like legs and adjusting for recovery and biomechanical safety with activities such as heat-cold contrast sessions for recovery.\n\nThe podcast also explores the benefits of long endurance workouts, the importance of resistance training coupled with tailored sets and repetitions for hypertrophy or strength gains, and the significance of incorporating neck exercises for overall stability and safety. Huberman reinforces the necessity of balancing fitness types throughout the week, providing a foundation for full-body health.\n\nAdditionally, he announces the launch of the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel, offering in-depth responses to listener questions and exclusive content.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So it might be anywhere from three to four sets per exercise. Again, still just two exercises and longer rest between sets, anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes if it's really heavy leg work. And then for the next month, switch to repetition range that's closer to eight to 12, maybe even 15 repetitions per set, but do fewer sets overall. So maybe just two to three sets per exercise, again, just two exercises per muscle group typically. And shorten the rest between sets so that it's more in the 90 second, maybe even as short as 60 seconds rest between sets, but typically 90 seconds to about two minutes or two and a half minutes. So basically it's one month heavier, the next month slightly lighter, although I wouldn't say light, I would say moderate weight and moderate rep range. That tends to work well for me. It also adheres to a principle that came up during the discussion, again, with Dr. Andy Galpin, that for hypertrophy, you really can use repetition ranges anywhere from five to 30, three zero reps. But he emphasized changing the repetition ranges in order to offset boredom.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required. Dr. Balcetis discusses the importance of not only setting goals but also planning for obstacles and creating actionable steps to overcome them. The conversation highlights the power of vision as a tool for enhancing motivation and the practical applications of this research for everyday goal achievement.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balcetis\nTranscript: But is there a kind of a higher level, kind of a black belt version of what we're talking about here, where not only am I focusing on a specific visual location as an intermediate or a long-term goal, or I'm using an app to ask me a question and tap into how I'm feeling, create a visual representation of my motivational state, but that I'm also making my phone as bright as possible. I'm also trying to take that visual window and actually pay attention to more of the details at that location. Or is it simply a matter of kind of, in geek speak visual neuroscience, we would just call this like low spatial frequency, just sort of grabbing a black and white snapshot of something here or there in my mind. If I attach more detail and effort to the specific thing that I'm focused on, is there any evidence that that's more effective? It certainly, you know, changes what our brains are doing. So, you know, how do we define effectiveness? That's a question for philosophers and that scientists will always- Will it keep me running? Yeah. It will when you use it towards the end of your run, just like you've picked up on. Yeah.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And so next we're going to talk about what the literature says about things like visualization, immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals, and how to best achieve those. And then we're going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use. It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you, the listeners, in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice that you can do anytime, any place to really identify what it is specifically that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal. Focusing our visual attention on one particular point is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit. And if you'd like to read some of the scientific studies or read a review of the scientific studies that have looked at how narrowing one's visual attention can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals, I'll put a link to this study. The title of the study is Keeping the Goal in Sight, Testing the Influence of Narrowed Visual Attention on Physical Activity. And this is a paper from Emily Balsettis' lab. It focuses mainly on physical activities, but it mentioned some other things as well. This is an article published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals\" episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses strategies for setting and achieving personal goals. He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\nTranscript: And it allows you to increase your level of focus, your level of motivation, and the sustainability of your focus and motivation while in goal pursuit. So it's a quite valuable protocol to incorporate, and it's something that you can do once for 30 seconds and then lean into whatever it is, your writing process, your running process. It's something that you could do repeatedly throughout that learning bout, and it's something that you can practice offline a little bit away from that training bout as a means to sort of learn and get familiar with so that then you can incorporate it very quickly and repeatedly and with much more effectiveness during these different learning bouts. Again, it's a highly valuable tool that's grounded in neural circuitry, grounded in neurochemistry, and that Emily Balchettis' lab has shown in numerous domains, physical pursuits, cognitive pursuits can really help people achieve their goals and to achieve them more easily, or at least with less perceived effort and more quickly. Now we can get a bit more granular about the incorporation of this tool, this protocol, but before we do, we should acknowledge that all of the things that lend themselves to improved cognitive focus and physical ability still hold true, right?\n------------------------\n"

It will when you use it towards the end of your run, just like you've picked up on. Yeah.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The episode \"How to Focus to Change Your Brain\" from the Huberman Lab podcast, hosted by Andrew Huberman, delves into the science of neuroplasticity\u2014the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience. Huberman explains that neuroplasticity is not just for children; adults can also rewire their brains with the right practices and conditions. He emphasizes the importance of focused attention, alertness, and the use of certain neurochemicals like epinephrine and acetylcholine to facilitate plasticity. Practical advice is given on how to improve focus, including managing sleep, motivation, and practicing visual focus. Huberman also touches on the use of pharmacology, like caffeine or nicotine, to enhance alertness and cholinergic transmission, which can aid in the neuroplasticity process. The episode provides insights into how we can harness our brain's plasticity to learn and adapt at any age, given the right conditions and practices.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Spending just 60 to 120 seconds focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen, meaning just on my screen with nothing on it, but bringing my eyes to that particular location increases not just my visual acuity for that location, but it brings about an increase in activity in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated with gathering information from this location. So put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus, practice visual focus. Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses, that's fine. You of, would want to use those. You don't want to take those off and use a blurry image. The finer the visual image and the more that you can hold your gaze to that visual image, the higher your levels of attention will be. Many times on Instagram, and here I've been teased for not blinking very often. That's actually a practiced thing. We blink more as we get tired, which as you hear it, you'll probably just say, duh. As we get tired, the neurons in the brainstem that are responsible for alertness and that hold the eyelids open start to falter and our eyelids start to close.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So what is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location? Well, it turns out that we have two branches of our visual system. So visual information all comes in through our eyes, but then it can head down two different pathways. One pathway is engaged when our vision is brought to a common point, what we call a vergence eye movement. So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point, regardless of how far away from us that point is, our visual system engages a certain set of neurons, neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time. Just think of it as a very detailed camera of the visual world. And it tends to be very restricted. The other pathway through the visual system is a so-called Magnocellular pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking in global information about lots of things that are happening around us, movement of things to our right, movement of things to our left, things that are happening down on the ground and all around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural circuits that are associated with alertness and attention.\n------------------------\n"

For years, I had the same recurring nightmare over and over and over again. And it was so salient and so clear. And I'm not going to share what it is because it's not that it's that disturbing. It was just, I think it was the emotional load of it and just how salient certain features were. Like one person who's a real life person had a particular clothing on. And it's like, and that just served as this cue. And I don't know if I ever did any direct work to try and deal with it, but now it almost seems silly to describe it. Oh yeah. Well, dreams are usually silly to describe. Yeah, it was pretty silly, but it was a pretty violent dream. Yeah.

So that sound is now this new thing that it should be associated with safety. And that might be enough, maybe, I hope, to knock you out of that repeated nightmare and maybe even start you on the path to recovery because if you can calm down about those nightmare states of sleep then maybe your locus surrealis which is involved in stress can also relax and you can do the erasure parts that need to be done i love it i seem to recall a paper and i'll have to find the reference and and um send it to you we will also put in the show note captions that described a protocol that essentially matches this idea. And I think what they had people do was either cue themselves to a particular smell or tone in wakefulness, then to try and recall a recurring nightmare. Then during the night's sleep, they had the tone playing in the background, which would then cue them to the wakeful state. They're still asleep, mind you, but in the pseudo lucid or lucid state. And then try and change some variable, as you're describing. Some either look the predator in the eyes or do something different.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Sobel explains the science behind olfaction, our sense of smell, and chemosensation, our response to chemicals in the environment. They explore the surprising abilities of human olfaction, such as how we process chemical information from others to determine stress levels, hormone states, and even how tears can affect our hormone levels. The conversation covers the phenomenon of nasal cycling, which reflects the dynamic of our nervous system and impacts alertness. Dr. Sobel's work reveals that we are constantly sensing our own odors and subconsciously smelling ourselves to change cognition and behavior. Additionally, the discussion touches on the nasal cycle's connection to the autonomic nervous system and its potential as a non-invasive marker for conditions like ADHD. Finally, Dr. Sobel shares insights into the subconscious ways humans use smell for social interactions, such as identifying individuals and forming\nShow Guest: Dr. Noam Sobel\nTranscript: And it turns out that this is linked to balance in the autonomic nervous system. So as you and your listeners know, we have an autonomic nervous system that has a sympathetic and parasympathetic component to it. And they're in balance or imbalance in many diseases, for example. And this interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system drives the switch from left to right nostril. Yeah. Just to remind people, sympathetic nervous system has nothing to do with sympathy, has everything to do with generating patterns of alertness. It's sometimes called the fight or flight system, but any pattern of arousal, positive or negative, and then it's balanced in a coordinated way, or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic nervous system, which is sometimes called the rest and digest system, but is associated with all sorts of things, the sexual arousal response, and a number of other aspects of our physiology. So think of it like a seesaw of alertness and calm. Yeah? Perfect. So now imagine, right? Imagine you would walk around living your life, right?\n------------------------\n",

It is responsible for most of the states of mind and body in which we are quiescent, where we don't feel an impulse to move, or when we have a difficult time getting into action. So the sympathetic and the parasympathetic aspect of the autonomic nervous system are always in a push-pull with one another. Think of them more or less on a teeter-totter.

This is super important if you're thinking about tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower. If for instance, you love cold showers and ice baths, well, then it's very unlikely that taking cold showers or getting into an ice bath is going to increase your level of tenacity and willpower further. It might reinforce the tenacity and willpower that you've already built, but it's not going to increase it further. You need to add something or subtract something that makes it harder, not easier to engage in or resist a behavior. Okay, I want to be really clear about this.\n------------------------\n",

So the big takeaway is that if you want to increase your tenacity and willpower, you absolutely can. You can do that by triggering activation of this incredible hub within the brain, the anterior mid-singulate cortex, for which there is now a very large amount of evidence, is at least central to the whole process of generating tenacity and willpower, the I absolutely will do that, and the no, I absolutely won't do that. It's the resistance hub. It's the thing that's allocating resources to do the thing that we don't want to do or that someone's trying to prevent us from doing.

Dr. Tye's current work investigates social homeostasis, the idea that we have a set point for the amount of social interaction we need, which can vary based on whether we're introverted or extroverted. She has discovered neurons that are active when we feel lonely, suggesting a biological basis for the sensation of loneliness. Her team also explores social hierarchies, the impact of social media, and how these factors affect mental health.

So you're doing a tremendous service by sharing that somebody as successful as you does this presumably is successful in part because you do this.

The conversation delves into how the education system can influence learning and behavior, highlighting the importance of considering emotional systems as guides for learning and information retention. The episode emphasizes practical applications for parents, educators, and individuals seeking to optimize learning throughout life. It also explores the idea that learning styles vary and that understanding one's emotional responses can enhance the learning experience, whether in traditional or non-traditional settings.\nShow Guest: Dr. Mary Helen Immordino-Yang\nTranscript: Neurobiologically, that situation is inconducive. It is not conducive to being able to actually conjure an alternative perspective in which you construct a meaningful narrative with alternate ethical implications, with alternate prospective possible future outcomes, with alternate views of the historical precedent or context, being able to sort of mentally time travel into the space of those ideas is only really possible when people feel safe to think together. So it sounds like it's anti-creative. Yes. Creativity is also associated with the activations of these networks. Yeah. Causally so in some recent work. I had the good fortune of having dinner last year with somebody. I won't reveal who it is, but he runs a major social media platform. And he told me that in Japan, it's common for people to have two or three or even as many as seven different social media handles. And that they do this in order to embody different versions of themselves safely. So these are not troll accounts. These are not the accounts, and by the way, I see you, troll accounts, that say whatever and then you go to their accounts at some private account where they hide.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: The first neural circuit involved in creativity is the so-called executive network. This is kind of a goofy name because the neural circuits that I'm about to describe do a bunch of other things as well, but they certainly control what are called executive functions. Executive functions are functions that you and I both have, which is our ability to govern our thinking and our behavior in very deliberate ways. And that is largely accomplished through the use of the neural circuitry that sits right behind the forebrain, the so-called prefrontal cortex. Now the prefrontal cortex involves many different sub-regions. It has a bunch of different parts, just like any country has different states, et cetera, and provinces. Executive function involves the prefrontal cortex and some other neural structures. But for sake of this discussion, executive function and the prefrontal cortex are mainly responsible for suppressing action. That is for eliminating choices among the infinite number of choices that exist.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Mackey, a leading expert in pain medicine, clarifies the difference between nociception, the neural processes of encoding and processing noxious stimuli, and the subjective experience of pain. The conversation delves into the critical distinction between physical and emotional pain and how the brain's perception of pain can be influenced by psychological states like anxiety and depression.\n\nDr. Huberman and Dr. Mackey explore the role of the nervous system in chronic pain and discuss behavioral, psychological, nutritional, and pharmacological strategies for pain management. They touch upon the relationship between temperature and pain relief, as well as the controversial use of opioids in clinical settings. The episode also addresses the importance of understanding the distinction between hurt and harm, and how cognitive approaches such as attentional distraction and cognitive reframing can be effective in managing pain.\n\n\nShow Guest: Dr. Sean Mackey\nTranscript: And yes, the medications we have now, you know, we touched base on a few earlier, but we have over 200 medications available for pain. Very few of them FDA approved. We tend to steal from all the other fields. So you're talking about more than 200 medications that can be, yes, prescribed for pain, but as off-label treatments? Perfectly stated, yeah. There's only a few medications that are actually FDA-approved specifically for pain. So what we do is we borrow or steal from the psychiatrists some of their antidepressants, which will frequently work very effectively for pain, and work on those pain-related circuits in the brain. We take from the neurologist some of the anti-seizure medications because those medications, while reducing separately seizures, for people who don't have seizures, they work on ion channels. They work on other neuromodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry. We can take from the cardiologists medications that work on the heart, antiarrhythmia or heart rhythm drugs. They are potent sodium channel blockers. And the sodium channels, as you know, are responsible for the action potential that generates the nerve impulse signal.\n------------------------\n"

For example, suffering from autism spectrum disorder of the sort that they actually want and need therapeutic help. I think looking at the social connection circuitry through the lens of autism is going to be very interesting for us to do. I do have a question about what is being selected for in rewarding social interactions?

And again, in this era of vulnerability and whatnot, we're told like, yes, share everything that's on your mind. It can actually be counterproductive to vent. And the reason for that is that when you're venting about a hard situation that you're going through or something that you're frustrated about with yourself, typically the person you've invited into the conversation, they're a nice, empathetic person. They want to make you feel better.\n------------------------\n",

            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode with Andrew Huberman discusses the science behind mental training and visualization techniques and their impact on learning and performance across various domains. The podcast emphasizes that mental training and visualization, when done correctly, can significantly improve the acquisition and retention of skills, be it cognitive tasks, musical abilities, or motor skills in sports. Huberman highlights the importance of neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to adapt and change through experience, as the underlying mechanism that supports the benefits of mental training.\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of mental training and visualization, it must be structured in brief, specific, and repeated sessions that mirror the actual physical or cognitive tasks being trained. While mental training is not a replacement for physical practice, it serves as a powerful complement that can enhance learning when combined with actual experience. The podcast also explores individual differences in visualization capabilities and provides insights into how people with conditions like autism or synesthesia might experience mental imagery and visualization differently. Finally, Huberman outlines practical strategies for incorporating\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So the point here is that it's not as if there is zero utility to third person mental training and visualization. There can be, but first person mental training and visualization is going to be more effective as I mentioned before. And if you're going to use a third person mental training visualization, ideally you would be looking at yourself either on video or listening to yourself in audio and or video. That is going to be more effective than closing your eyes and trying to imagine yourself from a third person perspective in your mind's eye. Okay, so just to make it really simple, first person better than third person visualization. If you're going to go with third person visualization, try and go with real third person visualization where you're actually seeing and or hearing yourself on a screen. And again, this was somewhat of a surprise to me. I always thought that mental training and visualization was done with eyes closed. I thought, okay, close your eyes. You imagine this, you imagine that. That's actually not the case for many, many studies, some of which are considered real hallmark studies within the field of mental training and visualization and the different neural circuits that it recruits.\n------------------------\n"

They emphasize that while hydration and whole food nutrition lay the foundation for good health, there are circumstances where supplementation can be beneficial. Dr. Galpin highlights that supplements can be consumed in high concentrations not typically found in nature, which can have significant effects on performance and recovery. However, he cautions against over-supplementation, as it can be unproductive or even harmful. He advocates for precision supplementation based on individual biological testing to provide only what is necessary for each person. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Galpin also discuss creatine as a top supplement due to its wide-ranging benefits for muscle performance, cognitive function, and potential impacts on bone density and neurological health. They stress the importance of consistent supplementation over time to raise baseline functioning and improve resilience. The conversation includes a detailed look at hydration strategies and the potential consequences of both dehydration and overhydration.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: And so because caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist effectively, while caffeine is present in those receptors, you don't feel as sleepy. You have more energy. Your reaction time goes down. Memory is enhanced, focus, performance of all kinds. Yes, but then when that caffeine is dislodged from the receptor, then the adenosine can act even more potently at those receptors. So it's sort of like being able to borrow against the normal variations in wakefulness and sleep. And this is why we encourage people, if they're not training first thing in the morning, to push their caffeine intake out about 90 to 120 minutes after waking so they can clear some of that adenosine in the morning, which tends to happen even after we wake up. People can listen to episodes on Master Your Sleep or Perfect Sleep or the caffeine episode to understand more about that. But the final thing I just want to say here, and then it prompts a question, is in thinking about supplement protocols, I think a lot of people assume that once they start taking something, they're going to have to take it all the time.\n------------------------\n",

He explains that memory is not just about learning, but also about placing life events into context, linking immediate experiences with past and future ones. Huberman promises to make the science accessible and discusses specific protocols grounded in extensive research that can enhance learning and memory. The episode also touches on unlearning and forgetting, providing tools to reduce the emotional weight of negative experiences. Additionally, he covers topics like deja vu, photographic memory, and how to use the visual system to improve memory. Huberman emphasizes that these insights are based on a solid understanding of brain systems and are separate from his roles at Stanford, aligning with his mission to distribute zero-cost consumer information about science.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, caffeine in the form of coffee or yerba mate or any other form of caffeine does create a sense of alertness in our brain and body. And it does that through two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is by blocking the effects of adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body the longer that we are awake. And it's largely what's responsible for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue when we've been awake for a very long time. Caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of adenosine. It's a competing agonist, not to get technical, but it binds to the receptor for adenosine for some period of time and prevents adenosine from having its normal pattern of action and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue. But it also increases state of alertness. So while it's reducing fatigue, it's also pushing on neurochemical systems in order to directly increase our alertness. And it does that in large part by increasing the transmission of epinephrine, adrenaline, in the brain and body.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Stop Headaches Using Science-Based Approaches\" features Dr. Andrew Huberman discussing various types of headaches, including migraines, tension headaches, and cluster headaches, and their underlying biology. He emphasizes that understanding the specific type of headache and its biological basis is key to selecting effective treatments. Huberman explores both pharmaceutical and natural remedies, emphasizing that many natural treatments can be as effective, if not more so, than drugs, without the side effects. He also debunks the misconception that natural treatments are not scientifically grounded, explaining that they are based on a solid understanding of headache mechanisms. The episode also covers the role of muscular tension, vasodilation, meningeal irritation, and neural and inflammatory responses in causing headaches. Huberman provides insights into how the nervous system processes pain, the importance of distinguishing between different types of headaches, and the potential treatments for each.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Well, one of the main ways in which caffeine makes us more alert is that it occupies the receptors for something called adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body more and more the longer we've been awake. It's one of the things that makes us feel sleepy. So when we drink caffeine, that caffeine occupies the adenosine receptor and the adenosine cannot have its normal effect of making us sleepy. When that caffeine wears off, the adenosine can bind and we feel sleepy. Adenosine is a vasodilator. So when we drink caffeine, because it blocks the effects of adenosine, there is a vasoconstriction associated with drinking caffeine. So if you have a headache that is associated with excessive vasodilation and pressure in the head, indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction by preventing that adenosine pathway that would normally lead to vasoconstriction, and you can get some relief from that headache. However, caffeine is also a vasodilator.\n------------------------\n"

Caffeine is a widely used stimulant that not only increases alertness and reduces fatigue but also acts as a powerful reinforcer, meaning it increases our liking for the foods, drinks, and even contexts associated with its consumption. Huberman delves into the positive health benefits of caffeine, which include neuroprotective, antidepressive, and performance-enhancing effects. However, he also addresses the importance of mindful caffeine consumption, as its reinforcing properties can lead to strong preferences that may not always align with healthy choices.\n\nAdditionally, Huberman explores a molecule called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide one), which is associated with reduced hunger and increased satiety through its action in the brain and gut. He highlights new findings on GLP-1's role in stimulating thermogenesis and converting white fat cells into metabolically active beige and brown fat\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: By delaying caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking, there are a couple of things that are accomplished. First of all, you offset that afternoon crash, and this is an effect that many people experience the very first time they start delaying their caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking. And the reason this works so well is the following. As I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule that builds up the longer that we are awake. It is a molecule that is reduced or cleared from our system by sleep. So when we emerge from sleep, regardless of how long we've slept, our adenosine levels are lower than they were when we went to sleep the previous night. If you slept well enough and long enough, those adenosine levels can be very, very low, but they are never completely zero.\n------------------------\n",

He emphasizes that sleep is vital for mental and physical health, performance, immune function, and overall well-being. He provides practical advice on how to shift sleep schedules for work or travel, fall back asleep if waking at night, and recover from poor sleep. Huberman explains that light exposure, temperature, food intake, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools are key levers for sleep optimization. He outlines a 24-hour cycle with critical periods for leveraging these tools, highlighting the importance of morning sunlight to set the body's clock, regulating light and temperature in the evening to prepare for sleep, and managing caffeine and food timing. Supplements like magnesium threonate, apigenin, theanine, glycine, GABA, and inositol are discussed for their sleep benefits. Digital tools like non-sleep deep rest scripts and self-hypnosis are also\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Again, caffeine is a denosine antagonist or effectively works as a adenosine antagonist and limits sleepiness. I highly recommend that everybody delay their caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking. However painful it may be to eventually arrive at that 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you want, and I encourage you to clear out whatever residual adenosine is circulating in your system in that first 90 to 120 minutes of the day, get that sunlight exposure, get some movement to wake up and then, and only then start to ingest caffeine, because what you'll do if you delay caffeine intake until 90 to 120 minutes after waking is you will avoid this so-called afternoon crash. And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy in the afternoon, but it's not going to be that massive crash. I've talked about the reasons for that crash on previous episodes, but if you delay your caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you are doing yourself a great service towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash.\n------------------------\n",

He highlights new findings on GLP-1's role in stimulating thermogenesis and converting white fat cells into metabolically active beige and brown fat\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Why would you want to delay your caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking? The answer to that is very simple. Many people wake up in the morning, they drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes within two minutes of waking, and they feel more alert naturally. That makes sense because of the effects of caffeine in blocking the effects of adenosine that I talked about earlier and its effects on other neurotransmitter systems. But then what they find is that in the early afternoon, in particular after lunch, they experience a dramatic dip in their overall levels of energy, the so-called afternoon crash. And in most cases, the way they respond to that is to ingest more caffeine, which indeed can increase their levels of mood and alertness. However, as we'll soon talk about, there is a problem with ingesting caffeine in the afternoon if it falls within eight or 10, or dare I even say 12 hours of going to sleep. And that is the caffeine ingested in the afternoon for most everybody, I'd say for 95 plus percent of people, disrupts the architecture and quality of their nighttime sleep.\n------------------------\n"

If you set out those goals, then the specific days that you do each workout isn't as critical, but the specific spacing is. So for instance, you're not going to want to do your high intensity interval training the day after you train your legs, because if you're doing that high intensity interval training correctly, you're going to be taxing your legs and eating into their recovery. And so you want to space them out by two or three days. So I think you'll notice that the point is really to optimize everything on the whole, rather than any one specific aspect of training or adaptation. Now that said, I do realize that some people might be hyper-focused on things like strength and hypertrophy and the aesthetics that come with it.

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 41, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the effects of fasting and time-restricted eating on various aspects of health, including weight loss, muscle maintenance, organ health, and overall well-being. He explains the concept of intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, which involves eating during specific periods of a 24-hour cycle. The episode explores how different schedules of eating can impact health in numerous ways, such as influencing fat loss, muscle dynamics, organ function, and even cognitive and mood states. Huberman emphasizes the importance of the timing of food intake, as it is as crucial as what is eaten. He also introduces tools and strategies to help manage eating schedules without being overly strict, including ways to mitigate the negative effects of occasionally deviating from a set fasting schedule. The episode discusses a study on fasting blood glucose as a predictor of mortality, highlighting the differences between human and mouse studies, and stresses the importance of considering the species when interpreting research on diet and health\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, is the increase in blood glucose that occurs from high intensity interval training early in the day, is that detrimental? Not necessarily so. That oftentimes is associated with the shuttling of nutrients to the muscles that have just done a lot of hard work. So it's not that high intensity interval training should not be done early in the day. In fact, for many people, including myself, training early in the day, just for the way that my psychology and biology works is always better for me than training later in the day. And the other important thing to mention is that high intensity interval training done late in the day can be beneficial from the perspective of glucose clearing, lowering blood glucose and helping transition from the fed to the fasted state in preparation for sleep. However, if you're ingesting caffeine or anything to engage in that high intensity interval training in a way that prevents you from getting to sleep, well, then it's going to be detrimental overall.\n------------------------\n",

The episode covers a wide range of protocols including how to structure a fitness regimen and integrate recovery, nutrition, and supplementary measures to augment strength, hypertrophy, endurance, anaerobic capacity, and more. Huberman highlights select protocols he has incorporated into his routine that are fun and time-efficient and encourages listeners to tailor these strategies to their goals without significantly increasing workout duration.\n\nKey components of any fitness program consist of a combination of cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. The episode emphasizes the necessity of including different training types (like zone two cardio, strength sessions, and different cardiovascular workouts) and recovery to make continuous progress.\n\nSpecific tools discussed include \"meshing\" zone two cardio with daily activities, like walking, to hit the recommended 200 minutes per week without additional scheduling.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: It's the kind of thing that you might throw in once every two weeks or once every four weeks as a replacement for your other high intensity interval training. The sugar cane involves selecting some form of exercise that you can do at high intensity safely. That of course will differ between individuals. For some of you, it will be a stationary bike. For others of you, it will be a road bike. For others of you, it will be running. And for others of you, it will be rowing. The exact form of exercise is not important. What is important is that you can generate a lot of intensity. So you're going to be doing some sprint-like work, although not all out sprints, except on the final round. I'll explain where all this is going in a moment. But again, you need to select a movement that you can do without injuring yourself while still performing a movement at high intensity. So for me, that would be running. For you, it might be something else. The sugar cane is pretty straightforward in structure. It involves three rounds after a brief warmup, of course.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the episode featuring Dr. Andy Galpin, the discussion with Dr. Andrew Huberman centers on how to design an effective fitness and exercise program that aligns with individual goals for fitness and sports performance. Dr. Galpin emphasizes the importance of understanding the physiological adaptations behind different training protocols and how to combine them to achieve multiple fitness adaptations simultaneously, such as strength, hypertrophy, and endurance. He advises listeners on structuring their training plans to make consistent progress and offers strategies for those with varying time constraints and equipment access. The conversation also covers the importance of having a specific plan for training and the role of progressive overload in achieving fitness goals. Dr. Galpin suggests that adherence to a structured plan can lead to better results compared to a non-structured approach. He introduces a 10-step approach to designing training programs, which includes assessing goals, identifying obstacles (defenders), and considering life events and time constraints when planning training frequency and duration. The episode also touches on the psychological aspects of goal\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: It is the universal substrate for all of that. And I actually think there's some real gems of information in the study design that you described. So just cue that for maybe a potential collaboration between our laboratories. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's very important, but it does cue up another question relevant to fitness in particular, which is what are your thoughts on intermediate goals? So let's say my goal is to drop two percentages, 2% of body fat from where I am now, a year from now, roll into the next year from now, about 2% lower on body fat, but maintain my lean body mass, or maybe even increase it. Yep. How should I assess progress? You know, because the dopamine system loves a goal that it loves anticipation of a goal, but it responds best to, we sort of re-up, if you will, our dopamine. Anytime we get a signal that we are on the right track to that goal. And that signal could be, okay, I did the workout. I just trust that these workouts are going to give me the result I want.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the episode featuring Dr. Andy Galpin, the discussion focuses on endurance, fat loss, and the science behind various training protocols for achieving specific fitness goals. Dr. Galpin emphasizes that endurance training isn't just for athletes but has benefits for longevity and aesthetics as well. He breaks down endurance into two main factors: fatigue management and fueling. The conversation also debunks the myth that lifting weights is only for muscle gain, highlighting the importance of endurance for overall health.\n\nDr. Galpin introduces the concept of mechanical efficiency, particularly in breathing and posture, as key to improving endurance quickly. Nasal breathing is suggested as a simple technique to enhance breathing mechanics. The episode also explores the idea of \"exercise snacks,\" short bouts of intense exercise like running up stairs, which can improve cardiovascular fitness and metabolic health even in an office setting.\n\nFurthermore, the discussion covers the crossover concept, where different intensities of exercise utilize varying fuel sources (fat vs. carbohydrates), and the misconception that training fasted\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic capacity? Keeping in mind what you said before, which is that specificity or precision, as you've raised it, is important. That is, if I want to train anaerobic capacity for sprinting, I probably should have been sprinting. Cycling, I was on the assault bike and so on. How many of those one minute all out sprints or 30 second all out sprints on the bike could and should one perform per workout and per week? So marching through exercise choice. Yep, let's do it. Order, volume, frequency and progression. Yep. Choice of exercises, train for what you want to improve. Is that right? Not necessarily. So in this particular case, if you have a specific goal, yes, of course, do it. Exercise choice, a couple of things you want to look for. You want to pick something that you feel extremely confident in the movement with. Because you're going to forget your brain very quickly here because you're going to go into our pain cave. So if you're not comfortable running, don't go run here.\n------------------------\n"

He clarifies that strength training is essential for maintaining muscle power and strength, which is crucial for everyday movements and preventing falls as we age. The conversation also touches on the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training for cognitive function, immune health, and overall longevity. Dr. Galpin dispels misconceptions about strength training, emphasizing that it can be started at any age and is not solely for building muscle mass, but also for maintaining functional abilities.

And then also make sure that one is using full range of motion and perfect form as it were. Now, of course, that is one tiny slice of the possible rep cadences and ways to approach resistance training. Although I think it's a pretty good one. What are the general parameter sets that one needs to consider? You could imagine lifting, you know, four seconds concentric, pause for one, pause for two, eccentric. I realize there's an infinite number of variations here. But is there a way to use rep cadence, repetition cadence, that is, as a way to work through weak points and to be strong in every position of the movement? Yeah, a lovely question.\n------------------------\n",

So what I will lay out to you is a case for which you should bounce, a case for when you should go fast, a case for when you should be under control. All of these things are different variables we can modify and get different adaptations for it. Is there a way that you could lay out for us optimal repetition cadences for strength specifically versus hypertrophy specifically, just to sort of bookend the conversation and then migrate toward the middle in terms of rep cadences that would satisfy the desire to have a bit of both. We can get pretty close. Yeah. So when you're talking about strength versus hypertrophy, remember strength is movement. Hypertrophy is muscle size. That's the key to your answer here. So when you're trying to get stronger, what you're effectively trying to do is get better at producing a certain amount of force through movement. Now force is mass times acceleration. So what's the mass in the bar multiplied by how well I can accelerate it?\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Learn Skills Faster,\" Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford, discusses the neuroscience of skill acquisition and how to optimize learning. He emphasizes the importance of errors in the learning process, as they signal the brain to focus attention and open up opportunities for neuroplasticity. Huberman advises maximizing repetitions during practice sessions and allowing the brain to rest afterward to consolidate learning. He also debunks the notion that slow movements are best for beginners, suggesting that they are more beneficial once some proficiency is achieved. Huberman touches on the use of metronomes for advanced learners to increase the pace and number of repetitions. He concludes that the key to faster skill learning is to perform many repetitions, pay attention to errors, and allow for periods of rest post-practice for the brain to process and consolidate the new skills.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: You can use a metronome, and obviously musicians do this, but athletes can do this too. You can use a metronome to set the cadence of your repetitions. Now, for swimmers, there's actually a device I was able to find online. I forget what the brand name was, and that's not what this is about, but that actually goes in the swim cap that can cue you to when you need to perform another stroke. And for runners, there are other metronome type devices that through headphones or through a tone in the room, if you're running indoors or on a treadmill, will cue you to when you basically you need to lift your heels. And if you do that, what athletes find is they can perform more repetitions, they can generate more output, you can increase speed. A number of really interesting things are being done with auditory metronoming. And then I'm involved in a little bit of work now that hopefully I'll be able to report back to you about using stroboscopic metronoming.

They wanna keep not only six feet away, but stay at home and never touch you. That loss of basic humanity is the opposite of what I feel in jujitsu, where it was like that contact where you're like, I don't give a shit about whatever rules we're supposed to have in society where you're not, you have to keep a distance and all that kind of stuff. Just the hug, like the intimacy of a hug that's like a good bear hug and you're like just controlling another person. And also there is some kind of love communicated through just trying to break each other's arms. I don't exactly understand why violence is such a close neighbor to love, but it is?

And it's just bred more self-awareness in me. And so I would encourage people to actually seek out connections in uncomfortable spaces because that will allow you to fill in at least some of the gaps. Now, some of the gaps will truly only be revealed to you because of life experiences. So I'm thinking in my own life. So I thought I grieved in a very particular kind of way. And then during COVID, my husband and I experienced multiple pregnancy losses with our surrogate. And I found myself grieving in a way that was completely foreign to me. I don't think talking to anyone would have revealed to me that I was going to grieve in this way where usually I would reach out to people and I would want to stay connected.

Huberman discusses the mechanisms of olfaction (smell), the different types of odors, and how certain smells can modulate our biology, including hormone levels. He also explains how the act of sniffing can enhance cognition and outlines practical sniffing exercises to improve one's sense of smell and taste. The episode further covers the potential sixth taste sense for fat, and the relationship between the tongue, digestion, and the gut-brain axis. Huberman emphasizes the importance of these senses for survival, such as detecting energy sources or avoiding toxins, and how they can be trained and maintained for better health and brain function.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: There's also a lot of interest right now in loss of sense of smell because one of the early detection signs of COVID-19 was a loss of sense of smell. So I just briefly want to talk about loss of sense of smell and regaining sense of smell and taste, because these have powerful implications for overall health, and in fact, can indicate something about brain damage and can even inform how quickly we might be recovering from something like a concussion. So our olfactory neurons, these neurons in our nose that detect odors are really unique among other brain neurons because they get replenished throughout life. They don't just regenerate, but they get replenished. So regeneration is when something is damaged and it regrows. These neurons are constantly turning over throughout our lifespan. They're constantly being replenished. They're dying off and they're being replaced by new ones. This is an amazing aspect of our brain that's basically unique to these neurons. There's one other region of the brain where there's a little bit of this maybe, but these olfactory neurons, about every three or four weeks, they die.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In episode 76 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the importance of flexibility and stretching for movement, injury prevention, inflammation reduction, and even impacting tumor growth. The episode delves into the biological mechanisms of stretching, including the role of motor neurons, sensory neurons, and connective tissue. Huberman explains the different types of stretching\u2014dynamic, ballistic, and static\u2014and their effects on sports performance and pain tolerance. He emphasizes that static stretching, held for around 30 seconds, is most effective for long-term flexibility gains and should be performed consistently. The discussion also touches on the role of the brain's insula and van Economo neurons in modulating the body's response to stretching and pain. Huberman offers practical advice on how to improve flexibility using science-supported stretching protocols, suggesting that stretching for at least five minutes per week, distributed over multiple days, can enhance range of motion.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: We haven't talked about that yet. In general, to avoid injury, it's a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit before doing these kinds of stretches, even these static stretches, which we can sort of ease into and don't involve ballistic movement by definition. And the basic takeaway that I was able to find was that if we are already warm from running or from weight training or from some other activity, that doing the static stretching practice at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular or other physical session would allow us to go immediately into the stretching session because we're already warm, so to speak. Otherwise, raising one's core body temperature by a bit by doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements, provided you can do those without getting injured, seems to be an ideal way to warm up the body for stretching. We should be warm or warm up to stretch, although those warmups don't have to be extremely extensive. And then just by way of logic, doing the static stretching after resistance training or cardiovascular training seems to be most beneficial.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode 76 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the importance of flexibility and stretching for movement, injury prevention, inflammation reduction, and even impacting tumor growth. The episode delves into the biological mechanisms of stretching, including the role of motor neurons, sensory neurons, and connective tissue. Huberman explains the different types of stretching\u2014dynamic, ballistic, and static\u2014and their effects on sports performance and pain tolerance. He emphasizes that static stretching, held for around 30 seconds, is most effective for long-term flexibility gains and should be performed consistently. The discussion also touches on the role of the brain's insula and van Economo neurons in modulating the body's response to stretching and pain. Huberman offers practical advice on how to improve flexibility using science-supported stretching protocols, suggesting that stretching for at least five minutes per week, distributed over multiple days, can enhance range of motion.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: In fact, and unfortunately we don't have time to go into this in too much detail today, I was able to find a number of papers that make the argument that static stretching prior to cardiovascular training, and maybe even prior to resistance training, can limit our performance in running and resistance training. I realize that's a controversial area. You have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial. You have those who say, no, it inhibits performance. And those that say, no, it's a matter of how exactly you perform that static stretching and which muscle groups and how you're doing this and how much time in between static stretching and performance. But to leave all that aside, doing static stretching after some other form of exercise, and if not after some form of exercise, after a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature, definitely seems like the right way to go. Now, for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well, doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment, even if that commitment is one to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches. I say this because you've got the warmup.\n------------------------\n",

So I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying that dynamic and ballistic stretching are not useful. They absolutely are. But in terms of increasing limb range of motion in the longterm of truly becoming more flexible as opposed to transiently more flexible, static stretching, which includes PNF, appears to be the best route to go. So if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion for a given muscle group, or perhaps for all muscle groups, although you can imagine that'd be pretty tough. I mean, you're not going to spend time, I could imagine, working on your tongue muscle control or neck muscle control and every muscle control, but most of us want to reduce so-called tightness, in air quotes, and increase limb range of motion for certain muscle groups.\n------------------------\n"

The discussion covers the mechanisms of action of common ADHD medications like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, and non-stimulant options such as modafinil. Huberman addresses concerns about these drugs' potential for addiction, psychotic symptoms, and long-term effects on brain function and physical health, including the impact on height and hormonal health. He also acknowledges the widespread off-prescription use of these medications among college students. The episode dives into the neurobiology of ADHD, explaining how these medications can paradoxically reduce hyperactivity by enhancing the prefrontal cortex's ability to regulate attention and suppress distractions.

But these modifications are largely erased in the transition between generations. So in the germline, in the sperm and the egg, and also in the early embryo, most of the modifications are removed so we can start a blank slate based on the genetic instructions. And this is crucial.

In certain cases, also, these chemical modifications can be added on and replicate and be preserved. For those who aren't as familiar with thinking about genes and gene structure and epigenetics, could we think of these, you mentioned the four nucleotide bases, T, G, A, and D, but could we imagine that through things like methylation, it's sort of like taking the primary colors and changing one of them a little bit, changing the hue just slightly, which then opens up an enormous number of new options of color integration. Absolutely. It's just more combinations, more ways, more information. There are the modifications of the DNA, and also there are the modifications of the proteins which condense the DNA that are called histones. So they are also modified by many different chemicals. Again, methylation is a very common modification, acetylation, even serotonin, the serotoninylation of histones. Serotonin. Right. This is a new paper from Nature from a few years ago.

And then you have in every cell of your body two copies, if you're a human, of every chromosome. So every gene is represented twice. These are called alleles, the different versions of the genes. And the thought is that once you enter the next generation, the two copies that you inherited are equal. It doesn't matter whether you acquire them from your mother or from your father, right? There are some situations where it does matter. There is a limited number of genes that are called imprinted genes where it does matter whether you inherit it from your mother or your father. And this is happening through epigenetic inheritance, not because of changes to the DNA sequence, but because of maintenance of these chemical modifications across generations. And as I recall from the beautiful work of Catherine Duloc at Harvard, that especially in the brain, there is evidence that some cells contain the complete genome from mom or the complete genome from dad.

So for example, people tell me, I'm growing horses for many years, and I just know that this horse has a particular character. It's very different from the other horse. And so this is epigenetic inheritance. No, it could be just genetically determined. Yes, this horse inherited a different set of genetic instructions, so it is different. It doesn't have to be about epigenetics. Epigenetic inheritance means that the environment of the parents somehow changed the children. And there are these two main barriers that are serious bottlenecks that we have to think what type of molecule and how they can be bridged. So one possibility is that it's really this limited number of chemical modifications that survive, which is about 10% or so. That could be very interesting. Not a small number. Not a small number, but perhaps. Perhaps. Okay? This is one possibility. The other possibility is that there are other mechanisms.

So when we say about epigenetic inheritance through the paternal lineage, through the fathers, we talk about two generations. And when you go through the mother, it's three generations to talk about when you need to invoke some real epigenetic mechanism. And there, the evidence becomes much more scarce in men. There are examples, more or less convincing. The field is evolving and improving a lot. So for example, now, many people use, the cutting edge is to use IVF in vitro fertilization or transfer of embryos to make sure that you actually, it's the heritable information and not the environment and that it goes through the germline. So this is something that is being done now. There are studies. You're talking about the three-parent IVF where they take the DNA from mom, the sperm from dad, and they take the DNA from mom and put it into a novel cytoplasm?\n------------------------\n"

I wouldn't suggest doing it one for every year. I wouldn't suggest a folder one for every 10 years. I think a three to five year increment seemed like a more reasonable and tractable way to go about this. So that's one of the sorts of tools that Dr. Conti referred to as to how to build up one's self-concept, which directly relates to things such as our confidence, our ability to track our own behavior, understand some of our motivations, both conscious and unconscious. But of course, that practice is mainly a conscious exercise. It's really not tapping directly into the unconscious in any kind of direct way as far as we know. Now we can contrast that with the tools and protocols that are designed to tap into the unconscious mind. And of course, there are a number of different ways to do this that were discussed in that four episode series with Dr. Conti. But one of the most powerful ways to do this is by thinking about, and indeed sometimes writing about, or even analyzing one's dreams.\n------------------------\n",

Dopamine is not only linked to pleasure but is also a key driver in our pursuit of goals and the effort we invest. By understanding dopamine dynamics, including peaks, troughs, and baseline levels, individuals can learn to manage their motivation more effectively. Huberman discusses the neurobiological circuitry behind dopamine's influence on our actions and offers practical tools to leverage dopamine for sustained motivation and goal achievement. The episode emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between dopamine, reward, and effort to optimize mental and physical health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And we are going to cover tools that will allow you to leverage your dopamine in order to have maximum motivation to overcome sticking points, which include things like procrastination, but also by understanding the neural circuits in the brain and body that release and use dopamine, but more importantly, by understanding what are called dopamine dynamics. That is what gives rise to big peaks in dopamine or troughs in dopamine, or what's referred to as our baseline level of dopamine, which turns out to be our baseline levels of motivation and feelings of wellbeing. By understanding how those things relate to one another, I assure you that by the end of today's episode, you will be in a far better position to understand why you become amotivated, why you procrastinate, how to ensure motivation on an ongoing basis, and even how to leverage effort and the desire to become motivated as a way to do just that, to become more motivated. Today's discussion is not about psychology, although I will center around practical everyday examples and offer many, many tools that you can implement if you choose. Today's discussion is really about pulling apart these things that we call motivation, reward, pleasure, procrastination, and understanding them in terms of their dopamine dynamics.\n------------------------\n",

I don't know, I don't want to do it or I'm not feeling motivated. Well, then there's a very potent set of tools that you can leverage to overcome states of lack of motivation, overcome procrastination, and indeed can help you deal with things like overthinking as it relates to procrastination and lack of motivation as well. So the way this works is the following. If you recall, a peak in dopamine is followed by a trough in dopamine. That trough in dopamine is experienced as pain or wanting or craving. That pain that I'm referring to is actually a craving or a wanting, and it's a craving or wanting for a specific state that you would like to achieve that is different than the one that you're in. You want to get out of that trough. And as you recall from earlier in the episode, that trough is the stimulus for the ongoing release of dopamine that provides the propeller, the motivation to go forward and seek some goal, okay?\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode on \"The Science of MDMA & Its Therapeutic Uses: Benefits & Risks\" explores the chemical properties, neurobiological effects, and potential therapeutic applications of MDMA, particularly for treating PTSD. MDMA, distinct from other psychedelics and stimulants, acts as an empathogen, increasing both dopamine and serotonin, which enhances social connectivity and empathy. Clinical trials have shown promising results for MDMA-assisted therapy in PTSD treatment, with changes in brain function and connectivity correlating with symptom relief. However, MDMA remains a Schedule I drug and is illegal to possess or sell in the U.S. The episode also discusses MDMA's history, its path to potential legality, and the differences between recreational and therapeutic use. Lastly, it addresses concerns about MDMA's neurotoxicity, exploring how therapeutic use may avoid toxicity, and the ongoing debate about its long-term effects.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: If you want to learn about mesolimbic reward pathways and dopamine and how they control everything from your level of motivation to your tendency to procrastinate or overcome procrastination, I've done two episodes about dopamine. You can simply go to hubermanlab.com, put dopamine into the search function, and you'll find at least two episodes on that topic. And you'll also find a number of different tools related to how one can better regulate their own patterns of dopamine release for sake of motivation, et cetera. So MDMA is increasing dopamine to increase reward to a particular experience. What's the experience? Well, this paper beautifully parses the fact that it is serotonin release within a structure called the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the reward pathway, which is rewarding the experience of social interaction. Now they do this by putting mice in arenas where they have the option of either spending time with other mice or not spending time with other mice and blocking the activation of certain brain areas. And again, using drug antagonists, et cetera.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals\" episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses strategies for setting and achieving personal goals. He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\nTranscript: There's a lot there to be understood and incorporated because it has to do with various things, not just in the realm of goal pursuit, but also feelings of wellbeing, staving off depression, things of that sort. The dopamine system is linked to oh so many important aspects of life, far too many than we could discuss right now. And we have those previous episodes in which we do discuss all of that material. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that dopamine is the molecule of motivation and to some extent reward, but really motivation.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode #90 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the effects of nicotine on the brain and body, its addictive nature due to its impact on brain chemicals, and strategies for quitting smoking or vaping. Nicotine, commonly consumed through smoking, has both detrimental health effects and, in specific non-smoking modalities, potential benefits for cognitive function. Huberman explains how nicotine increases dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which can enhance focus, alertness, and mood. However, smoking and vaping, particularly among young people, are on the rise and carry significant health risks due to the damage they cause to the body's endothelial cells and the presence of carcinogens. The episode also covers the challenges of quitting smoking due to nicotine's reinforcement through the dopamine system and offers insights into using nicotine replacement therapies effectively.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: If people are getting so much more dopamine so much more quickly from vaping, shouldn't they be feeling better? That brings us back to the critical, and I should say defining feature of the dopamine reward pathway for motivation and wellbeing, which is that initially a given substance will cause, let's say an eight out of 10, again, arbitrary units, but eight out of 10 increase in dopamine. But with repeated use, what ends up happening is that even at similar or higher levels of ingestion, so not just one inhalation a minute, but maybe two inhalations a minute or inhalation every 30 seconds, now it's level four out of 10 activation of dopamine, and then three, and then two, and eventually it drops below baseline. Now the whole system can be recovered by abstinence from nicotine consumption, but the dopamine system is applied to everything, all sense of wellbeing, all sense of motivation. So during the period in which one is abstaining from nicotine and vaping in particular, people do not feel good. They feel miserable. That's why it's called withdrawal.\n------------------------\n"

They explore a comprehensive range of topics related to male hormone health across all ages, including the impact of hormones on mood, libido, wellbeing, strength, cognition, and psychological factors. Dr. Gillett provides specific recommendations for hormone optimization tailored to different goals and life stages, discussing how to assess whether hormone levels are optimized and how often to test for them. They delve into the importance of behavioral foundations for optimal hormone function and the necessity of avoiding certain activities that could negatively affect hormone levels. They also address the timing of puberty and its implications for adult health, the influence of diet and exercise on hormone levels, and the significance of managing stress and maintaining social connections. The conversation covers the potential use of supplements and prescription drugs for hormone optimization, with an emphasis on doing so under medical supervision. Dr. Huberman emphasizes that the information provided is part of\nShow Guest: Dr. Kyle Gillett\nTranscript: I think of ghrelin as making me hungry. Hungry and angry. Why would I want to take something that would increase ghrelin signaling? Some people are trying to gain weight. It also does increase your growth hormone. So if your growth hormone is very low, you can consider it. Ibutamorin is a long acting, so it has a long half-life, also known as MK-677. It was studied mostly in growth hormone deficiency. And do these people get angry also? They can. Many people report a side effect of anxiety or significant hunger. Most people take it in the evening, so they don't notice that hunger as much. It can also greatly increase your blood glucose. So if you're insulin resistant or pre-diabetic, it gets especially concerning. This is one of those rare moments where I hear something and I think, okay, even though there's this kit of compounds that can increase GH and IGF-1, based on everything you're telling me, maybe just taking GH is the better option for those people because growth hormone, at least it's synthetic growth hormone is mimicking an endogenous hormone.\n------------------------\n",

He clarifies the confusion around the naming of peptides, which are often referred to by acronyms and numbers, and provides an organizational framework to understand their therapeutic uses, advantages, and risks. Huberman explains that peptides are small proteins that can have pleiotropic effects, meaning they can affect many aspects of cells and organ systems. He emphasizes the importance of using peptides prescribed by physicians, as opposed to those from gray or black markets, due to potential safety and efficacy concerns. The episode delves into specific peptides, including BPC-157 and thymosin beta-4, for tissue repair, and discusses peptides that influence growth hormone release, such as sermorelin and tesamorelin, highlighting their benefits\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So again, you want to avoid food in the hour and a half, probably two hours before taking them, and certainly in the half hour or longer after, which is why most people take them right before going to sleep and add or augment that big growth hormone pulse that occurs in the early part of the night. And then many people have perhaps heard of what's called MK-677, which is simply an oral version, a non-injectable, but oral version of these GHRPs. And it tends to have the same issues that the other GHRPs have, which are elevated cortisol, and in some cases, elevated prolactin as well. Okay, so if we just kind of zoom out from all this, we can say that yes, indeed, there are synthetic peptides that can potently increase growth hormone in IGF-1. I explained the rationale for why people would want that, or perhaps to explore that. I'm certainly not suggesting anyone do this. Again, I am suggesting that if you do explore it, you work with a board-certified physician and that you get these compounds from a quality compounding pharmacy or by their name brand prescription.\n------------------------\n",

Nowadays, there's a lot of excitement about continuous glucose monitors, and Levels allows you to assess how what you eat and what combinations of foods you eat and exercise and sleep and things like alcohol, should you indulge in alcohol and things of that sort, how those impact your blood glucose. Now, it's very important that the cells of your body, and in particular, the cells of your nervous system, not experience levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low, so-called hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. What levels allows its users to do is to understand how their specific routines, food intake patterns, exercise, et cetera, impact their blood sugar levels. I, like most people who use Levels, find that there's a lot to learn and a lot to be gained by understanding these blood glucose patterns.

He explores how certain foods can enhance focus, overall brain health, and cognitive longevity. He delves into the subconscious signals from the gut that influence food choices, explaining that neurons in the gut send signals about nutrient content to the brain. Metabolic accessibility of food to the brain and belief about the health benefits of food also play roles in dietary preferences. Huberman emphasizes that one can change their diet to crave healthier foods through understanding these mechanisms. He also revisits the topic of time-restricted feeding, highlighting the importance of consistent eating windows for benefits like weight management and improved sleep and cognition. The episode also touches on the roles of various nutrients in brain health, including omega-3 fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, and choline, and how they contribute to neuron function and integrity. Huberman shares his personal supplementation routine and discusses the importance of consuming\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: The studies of offsetting cognitive decline using alpha-GPC did use quite high dosages of 600 to 900 or even 1200 milligrams per day. So it has been used at those much higher concentrations, but because fortunately, at least not yet or not to my awareness, I'm not suffering from any cognitive decline, I will supplement with 300 milligrams every now and again. Next on my list of compounds that have been shown in peer-review reviewed research to improve neuronal and brain function is creatine. Creatine can be derived from meat sources. It can also be supplemented. Some of you are probably familiar with creatine or have heard about creatine from the context of the health and fitness world where creatine is used to bring more water into muscles, which can enhance the strength of those muscles, as well as bring water into other tissues. So it doesn't just draw more water into muscle, it can draw more water into the body generally. Creatine has also been shown to have an important role in brain function. And once again, this is something that came up during the discussion about depression a few episodes back, creatine can actually be used as a fuel source in the brain.\n------------------------\n",

He emphasizes that focus and the ability to ignore distractions are two distinct abilities, and both can be enhanced through various interventions. Huberman cautions against self-diagnosing ADHD, as many people may experience symptoms without meeting the full clinical criteria. He explores the genetic components of ADHD, its independence from intelligence, and the tendency for people with ADHD to have hyperfocus on subjects of intense interest.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in attention and motivation, its impact on specific brain circuits, and the \"low dopamine hypothesis\" of ADHD. He also discusses the use of stimulant medications like Ritalin and Adderall, which are chemically similar to street drugs but can be beneficial for ADHD when used responsibly under medical supervision.\n\nDietary interventions, particularly the reduction of simple sugars and the implementation of an oligoantigenic\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: One such compound is so-called alpha-GPC, which is a form of choline and increases acetylcholine transmission. Dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day, which is a very high dosage spread out, typically it's 300 or 400 milligrams spread out throughout the day, have been shown to offset some of the effects of age-related cognitive decline, improve cognitive functioning. People that don't have age-related cognitive decline, that's a very high dose. Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study or to enhance learning of any kind, they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams. That's more typical. Again, you have to check with your doctor. You have to decide if the safety margins are appropriate for you. Obviously, you'll want to check that out, but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focus by way of this cholinergic system. It stimulates acetylcholine release from both of those locations, the PPN in the back of the brain and nucleus basalis in the front of the brain.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Learn Skills Faster,\" Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford, discusses the neuroscience of skill acquisition and how to optimize learning. He emphasizes the importance of errors in the learning process, as they signal the brain to focus attention and open up opportunities for neuroplasticity. Huberman advises maximizing repetitions during practice sessions and allowing the brain to rest afterward to consolidate learning. He also debunks the notion that slow movements are best for beginners, suggesting that they are more beneficial once some proficiency is achieved. Huberman touches on the use of metronomes for advanced learners to increase the pace and number of repetitions. He concludes that the key to faster skill learning is to perform many repetitions, pay attention to errors, and allow for periods of rest post-practice for the brain to process and consolidate the new skills.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Alpha-GPC, alpha-glycerophosphocholine. See, if I keep doing it over and over, repetitions, alpha-glycerophosphocholine. There, I made an error. Okay, so the point is that alpha-GPC, which is, at least in the United States, is sold over the counter, typically is taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams. That's a single dose or have been shown to do a number of things that for some of you might be beneficial. One is to enhance power output. So if you're engaging in something like shot put throwing or resistance training or sprinting or something where you have to generate a lot of power, maybe you're doing rock climbing, but you're working on a particular aspect of your rock climbing that involves generating a lot of force, a lot of power, well then in theory, alpha-GPC could be beneficial to you. For the cognitive effects, the dosages are much higher, up to 1200 milligrams daily divided into three doses of 400 milligrams is what the studies that I was able to find show or used. The effects on cognitive decline are described as notable.\n------------------------\n"

The Hadza are one example. There are many different foraging populations, but the vast majority of these populations consume huge amounts of dietary fiber because plants are the reliable, consistent source. If you, as a hunter-gatherer, go on a hunt, usually that hunt is unsuccessful. I think the data are that one out of 20 to 30 hunts are successful in landing actually big game for the Hadza. They have birds that they shoot and small animals, but quite often, day after day, they're relying upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. They're relying on the plants in their environment. And actually, if you go to the data and look at what their food preferences are, their food preferences are actually meat and honey.

You know, I will back to Christopher's rule for a healthy diet, a lot of the macronutrient changes that we saw in their diet were consistent with healthy changes in diet, less saturated fat, less animal-based protein, more plant-based protein. So a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial kind of came in concert with just telling people eat a high fiber diet, high plant-based fiber diet. The people that were eating the high fermented food diet, they were instructed to basically eat foods that you could buy at a grocery store that were naturally fermented and contain live microbes.

So it sounds like the Hadza, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, you said would prefer to eat meat and honey, but they happen to consume a lot of plant fiber as a consequence of what's available. One of the questions I have as it relates to all of this is it sounds to me like there is no question from the pure vegan all the way to the extreme opposite, which would be pure meat diet, that avoiding processed foods is a good idea or heavily processed foods in general. And I mean, not that the occasional consumption is necessarily bad, but whether or not one is thinking about one macronutrient profile or another, it sounds like consuming processed foods is just bad for the microbiome. Can we say that categorically?\n------------------------\n"

And in that case, I recommend taking the carbon dioxide tolerance test over again. And almost always what you'll find is that you have been able to extend your carbon dioxide discard rate. And therefore you now fall into a different category, not just the lower medium, but the long carbon dioxide discard rate category. And you are able to extend the duration of those inhale hold, exhale holds during the box breathing.

So inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds very easy, right? How long do you inhale and then hold, exhale and then hold? Well, you now know. If you were in the low group of carbon dioxide discard rate, your inhale is going to be three seconds, your hold will be three seconds, your exhale will be three seconds, and then you repeat three seconds. So each size of the box, if you will, is going to be three seconds long. If you were in the moderate carbon dioxide discard rate category, then you're going to inhale for five to six seconds, hold for five to six, exhale for five to six, hold for five to six, repeat for about two minutes. You could do three minutes if you want, but I think it's important to have protocols that are feasible for most people. And that's going to mean doing things for about two to five minutes when it comes to these breath rehabilitation exercises for restoring normal breathing.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the podcast episode with Dr. Sara Gottfried, the conversation centers on optimizing female hormone health for vitality and longevity. Dr. Gottfried, an obstetrician-gynecologist and expert in hormone health, discusses the importance of managing the gut microbiome, nutrition, and exercise for maintaining healthy hormone levels. She emphasizes the unique needs of women regarding their gut microbiome and its influence on estrogen, testosterone, thyroid, and growth hormone. The discussion also covers the importance of omega-3 fatty acids and the right balance of resistance and cardiovascular training for women. Dr. Gottfried highlights the prevalence of digestive issues in women and the tools available for overcoming them to improve hormone health. She advocates for specific types of tests, including blood, urine, and microbiome tests, for women to understand their hormone status and trajectory. The conversation also touches on navigating different life stages, from puberty to menopause, and the role of hormone replacement therapy. Dr. Gottfried's expertise extends to intergenerational factors\nShow Guest: Dr. Sara Gottfried\nTranscript: Another group did box breathing, inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations. The duration of each of those inhales and holds was set by their carbon dioxide tolerance. So somewhere between three and eight seconds, depending on how well they regulate to carbon dioxide. Another group did cyclic sighing. So this would be double inhale through the nose. So big inhale through the nose, followed by a two lungs empty exhale. That second inhale after the first big long inhale through the nose is really important because it makes sure that all the collapsed alveoli, the lungs snap open. And then the exhale, you offload a lot of carbon dioxide. That's very similar to holotropic breathwork. Yes, not unlike holotropic breathwork, little bit pranayama-ish, but the exhale is rather passive as opposed to active. And then the fourth category was cyclic hyperventilation, which is a lot like TUMO, aka Wim Hof-ish breathing, different than Wim Hof breathing. So this would be, so very active inhales and exhales.\n------------------------\n"

He explains that these hormones are essential throughout life for the development and maintenance of the body and brain. Huberman emphasizes that thyroid hormone, which needs iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine to be produced, is crucial for converting energy from fats and sugars, and for promoting growth and repair in various tissues. He also discusses how growth hormone, which can be increased through proper sleep and exercise, is vital for tissue repair and maintaining a healthy body composition. Huberman provides actionable tools for modulating these hormones, including dietary adjustments and specific types of exercise. He also addresses the importance of maintaining proper levels of these hormones for cognitive function and overall health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So the takeaway here is that heat seems to have positive effects on growth hormone, big effects. It seems to have positive effects on reducing cortisol levels, and it does not seem to have effects on things like testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin directly. You can imagine that a shift in any hormone is going to alter the levels of other hormones down the line, sort of indirect effects. But in terms of direct effects, just during or immediately after the sauna bath, there were no effects. So we've talked about diet, supplementation, behavioral tools, and of course, we talked about the underlying biology and logic, and hopefully you heard the safety precautions for all of those. Now I'd like to just briefly talk about the prescription side of all this. There are, as we know, many people taking growth hormone because it's been prescribed to them by a doctor. And presumably there are people taking growth hormone, even though it has not been prescribed by a doctor, which is none of my business. But the point here is that most all of the hormones that we make have been synthesized. So there are versions of them in little bottles or little ampules that people can inject.\n------------------------\n",

He explores the science behind how heating from both external and internal sources impacts our biology, and how it can be harnessed through tools like saunas and local heat application. The episode delves into a study published in the journal Cell, which shows that local heating can convert white fat into metabolically active beige fat, potentially aiding in fat loss. Huberman also discusses how understanding the biology of burns has led to new methods to combat obesity and metabolic disorders. Throughout the episode, he emphasizes the importance of the proper application of heat for health benefits and cautions against the risks of overheating.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: But before I do that, I want to review some of the data and one study in particular that discovered certain forms of deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate very large increases in growth hormone output, which for people in their thirties, forties and beyond could be very useful and may also be useful for people who are just trying to stimulate the release of more growth hormone in order to, for instance, recover from exercise or stimulate fat loss or muscle growth or repair of a particular injury. The title of this paper is Endocrine Effects of Repeated Sauna Bathing. And this is a paper that was published in 1986, which is some years ago, but nonetheless serves as a basis for a lot of other studies that followed. So let me describe what they did in this study. They used an 80 degree Celsius environment. So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit. And they had subjects do this sauna for 30 minutes, four times per day. So that's two hours total in one day, 30 minutes in the sauna, a period of cool down rest, 30 minutes in the sauna again, cool down rest, a third and a fourth time.\n------------------------\n",

Along the lines of temperature and hormones, I just want to mention a very recent study just came out, March, April, 2021, endocrine effects of repeated hot thermal stress and cold water immersion in young adult men. Unfortunately, it was just in men. They didn't look at women, but nonetheless, I think the data are relevant to everybody as a general theme. This is Podstrowski et al. I will put a link to the study in the caption. And they looked at testosterone, prolactin, cortisol, et cetera. And what they found was that the sauna does indeed lead to a significant decrease in cortisol, a stress hormone, a hormone that you want to be released early in the day when you wake up, but sauna definitely led to a significant decrease in cortisol, but did not change testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin levels. So that's interesting. And it turns out that the cold did affect some of these hormones, but the results there were a little bit more mixed.\n------------------------\n"

Nicotine, commonly consumed through smoking, has both detrimental health effects and, in specific non-smoking modalities, potential benefits for cognitive function. Huberman explains how nicotine increases dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which can enhance focus, alertness, and mood. However, smoking and vaping, particularly among young people, are on the rise and carry significant health risks due to the damage they cause to the body's endothelial cells and the presence of carcinogens. The episode also covers the challenges of quitting smoking due to nicotine's reinforcement through the dopamine system and offers insights into using nicotine replacement therapies effectively.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: David Spiegel is 23% of people who do this hypnosis one time succeed in quitting smoking. Now in the old days, which actually wasn't that long ago, before the advent of smartphones and before the internet took off to the extent that it has now, this was done by having someone come into the clinic and Dr. Spiegel himself or one of his colleagues would take somebody through the hypnosis. Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis. There's a wonderful app that was developed by Dr. David Spiegel and others. It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I. I've talked about this app a few times on the podcast before because there are hypnosis scripts within the app for enhancing sleep, for improving ability of fall asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night, for focus and a number of other behavioral and emotional changes.

            "\nShow Summary: The podcast episode from the Huberman Lab discussed the importance of oral health, not just for the appearance and health of teeth and breath, but for overall bodily health, including brain and cardiovascular health. Andrew Huberman introduces oral health as the seventh pillar of mental health, physical health, and performance, emphasizing the impact of the oral microbiome on various bodily systems. He explains that oral health protocols can reverse early cavities and strengthen teeth through the process of remineralization, primarily influenced by saliva's pH level. Huberman discusses the importance of saliva and its role in oral and gut health, and offers insights into daily protocols for maintaining oral health, including zero-cost practices. He highlights the need for proper oral care routines, such as brushing and flossing, especially at night when saliva production decreases, to prevent cavities and promote overall health. The episode also touches on the implications of diet, hydration, and avoiding certain behaviors like mouth breathing, which can negatively affect oral health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera, but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification, supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you.

            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Supercharge Exercise Performance & Recovery with Cooling\" episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the science of how cooling certain areas of the body can dramatically improve exercise performance and recovery. He explains that cooling the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet, and the face \u2013 areas with special vasculature called arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) \u2013 can more effectively regulate core body temperature than cooling other parts of the body. This method of cooling can enhance endurance and strength significantly and is used by professional athletes and the military. Huberman emphasizes that cooling the entire body, such as with ice baths, is less efficient and could impede muscle recovery and growth. He also touches on the effects of substances like caffeine on body temperature and exercise performance, advising that caffeine should be used before, not after, workouts for those who are adapted to it.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And I think that's really where InsideTracker sets itself apart from other similar tests. What InsideTracker offers is, first of all, they make the tests very easy. They can come to your home to take your blood and DNA test, or you can go to a testing center nearby you. Then you get the information back. And rather than just getting information about whether or not the levels of various things are high or low, you also get to find out what to do about it. So it offers directives related to nutrition, to exercise and so forth. It really allow you to be in control of your overall health, both where you are now and its long-term trajectory. With InsideTracker, they also have something which is, it can give you a readout of your inner age. They have something called the inner age test that really compares your biological age to your chronological age, something that's of extreme importance and interest because it has to do with lifespan or predicted lifespan.

The episode delves into the biological mechanisms of stretching, including the role of motor neurons, sensory neurons, and connective tissue. Huberman explains the different types of stretching\u2014dynamic, ballistic, and static\u2014and their effects on sports performance and pain tolerance. He emphasizes that static stretching, held for around 30 seconds, is most effective for long-term flexibility gains and should be performed consistently. The discussion also touches on the role of the brain's insula and van Economo neurons in modulating the body's response to stretching and pain. Huberman offers practical advice on how to improve flexibility using science-supported stretching protocols, suggesting that stretching for at least five minutes per week, distributed over multiple days, can enhance range of motion.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So it appears that the greatest improvements in limb range of motion for your time spent and effort spent is going to be this minimum of five minutes per week to elicit a significant response with five days being the minimum weekly recommended frequency to achieve significant range of motion improvements. I confess this was pretty surprising to me when I compare flexibility training to say resistance training for strength and hypertrophy. I've had the experience and I know that other people have had the experience and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree that provided one trains hard enough and appropriately that you don't need to train resistance training five days a week in order to get significant improvements in strength and hypertrophy. Some people might need to, but you can get a lot of positive results in those variables with less frequent training, certainly with three or four days a week of training. And for cardiovascular training, I'm not aware of anyone having tested whether or not one very long run each week can actually increase cardiovascular fitness and you're not doing anything else. Although I have to imagine you'd probably see some improvement compared to not doing anything. But most people are doing repeated training sessions of cardiovascular strength training.\n------------------------\n",

Now, of course, there will be a ton of lifestyle factors. If you're a regular practitioner of yoga, if you have a dedicated stretching practice, if you're doing other things to improve your muscle contractibility, so you're doing resistance training, it turns out can actually indirectly improve flexibility. There are a number of different factors, but the key point is that maintaining some degree of flexibility and maybe even enhancing range of motion and flexibility is of immense benefit for offsetting injury, provided it's not pushed too far. There are a number of people who have pushed their limb range of motion so far that they experience all sorts of injuries, both acute and chronic injuries. Today, we'll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios. Okay, so we've established that there are mechanisms within the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue.\n------------------------\n",

The results clearly show that, quote, the change in flexibility appeared to be dependent on the duration and frequency of stretching. This is great. This tells us that stretching for a given amount of time scales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement that one will see. There were many interesting findings within this study, but the one that I'd like to highlight most is, quote, the results of this study suggest that a 30-second duration is an effective amount of time to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch in order to increase range of motion. No increase in flexibility occurred when the duration of stretching was increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds, or when the frequency of stretching was increased from one to three times per day. Okay, so now we're starting to lay down some parameters. What this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us, and we will get into those subsequent studies, is that ideally one would do static stretches that are held for 30 seconds, perhaps more in certain instances, and I'll explain when that can be useful, but here holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds did not turn out to be additionally useful.\n------------------------\n"

He clarifies that strength training is essential for maintaining muscle power and strength, which is crucial for everyday movements and preventing falls as we age.

He also discusses the neuromuscular adaptations that occur with strength training, such as improved nerve firing, muscle contractility, and changes in muscle fiber type.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Intentionally going slower is only reducing acceleration right so it's hard to argue that going slower is going to improve strength because you're simply reducing acceleration so you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate now does that mean if you're trying to get, there are no phases of your training in which you'll slow down or pause? No, of course not. There are certain rules in different organizations where you have to pause the bottom. Like there's all kinds of little things like that. But in general, we want to think about what are we trying to do here? We're trying to get better at moving a heavier mass at a faster rate of acceleration. That is more force. That is more strength. Hypertrophy is not that. The goal here is not a functional outcome. It is what is needed to cause the most amount of hypertrophy. And when you get to hypertrophy then, your optimal cadence is up to you. You can do any combination. In fact, you could do it the same exact cadence that you did your strength training with and get the same adaptations as hypertrophy if you modify the other variables appropriately. Or you could go slower.\n------------------------\n",

Huberman reinforces the necessity of balancing fitness types throughout the week, providing a foundation for full-body health.\n\nAdditionally, he announces the launch of the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel, offering in-depth responses to listener questions and exclusive content.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: It sounds so simple, three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing. So this could be while you're in the shower or when you arrive at your car, you might sit in your car quietly and do that if you have time, or maybe even while you're driving back to or onto your next destination, just to really slow down your breathing, to really look at the recovery period that has to follow each training session. And of course, during which the adaptations, the changes that make you more fit than you were going into the exercise occur. And that three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing has been shown in Andy's group and in related experiments, not exactly the same, but related experiments in our laboratory and in other laboratories to really so-called downshift the nervous system and really set you up for maximal recovery, rapid recovery, and allow you to lean into the next training session with full intensity when that training session eventually arrives. So it's a very simple tool, but a very potent tool for your overall fitness. So thank you for joining me for this discussion of what I'm calling a foundational, or I guess we could even get bold and call it an optimal fitness protocol.

So because that everything driving power and strength is quality based, you want to do these at the beginning of your workout. You would not want to do anything fatiguing before this. So no cardiovascular training, no other repetition to failure stuff. If you do those before and now you're slower, all you've done is practice getting slower. And so these need to be done when you're fresh. You also need to do them when you're very fresh because they are the most neurologically demanding. They're complicated. They tend to have multiple steps and they're often in multiple planes and coordination is a difficult thing. And if you're trying to do all that at maximum speed, your nervous system needs to be tremendously fresh. And so any amount of fatigue here is only going to compromise results. To kind of recap that, one of the major mistakes when training for strength, and especially power, is people worry way too much about fatigue. Those things should not be part of the equation. In fact, if they are, that's a very good sign you're not doing this correctly. These are non-fatiguing movements, especially speed and power.\n------------------------\n"

And that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep. So REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity to eliminate the meanings that don't matter. It's not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter, but it eliminates the meanings that don't matter. And that bears a striking resemblance to what happens early in development. This isn't a discussion about early in development, but early in development, the reason a baby can't generate coordinated movements and the reason why children can get very emotional about what seems like trivial events or what adults know to be trivial events, like, oh, the ice cream shop is closed and they just kind of, and then the kid just dissolves into, you know, a puddle of tears and the parents go, okay, well, it'll be open again another time.\n------------------------\n",

And the is a very simple word to spell, but things start to look a little distorted. And we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep for very long periods of time, they start hallucinating. They literally start seeing relationships and movement of objects that isn't happening. And so REM sleep is really where we establish the emotional load, but where we also start discarding of all the meanings that are irrelevant. And if you think about emotionality, a lot of over-emotionality or catastrophizing is about seeing problems everywhere. And you could imagine why that might occur if you start linking the web of your experience too extensively. It's very important in order to have healthy emotional and cognitive functioning that we have fairly narrow channels between individual things.

And that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep. So REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity to eliminate the meanings that don't matter. It's not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter, but it eliminates the meanings that don't matter. And that bears a striking resemblance to what happens early in development. This isn't a discussion about early in development, but early in development, the reason a baby can't generate coordinated movements and the reason why children can get very emotional about what seems like trivial events or what adults know to be trivial events, like, oh, the ice cream shop is closed and they just kind of, and then the kid just dissolves into, you know, a puddle of tears and the parents go, okay, well, it'll be open again another time.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Understanding and Using Dreams to Learn and to Forget\" episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the science of dreaming, particularly focusing on lucid dreaming, learning, and unlearning during sleep. He recounts his personal experience with a lucid dreaming mask and explains that while lucid dreaming is profound for some, it can disrupt restorative sleep for others. Huberman delves into the physiology of sleep, describing the 90-minute sleep cycles that include slow-wave (non-REM) and REM sleep, and how they differ in the early and later parts of the night. He emphasizes the role of slow-wave sleep in motor learning and retaining detailed information, and the importance of REM sleep in processing emotional experiences and unlearning emotional responses to traumatic events. Huberman also discusses the effects of sleep deprivation on emotional stability and the potential of consistent sleep patterns to improve learning. He touches on the relationship between sleep and neuroplasticity, and how various substances and activities can impact\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So it's very clear from laboratory studies where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged and we tend to catastrophize small things. We tend to feel like the world is really daunting. We're never going to move forward in the ways that we want. We can't unlearn the emotional components of whatever it is that's been happening, even if it's not traumatic. The other thing that happens in REM sleep is a replay of certain types of spatial information about where we were and why we were in those places. And this maps to some beautiful data and studies that were initiated by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago, showing that in rodents, and it turns out in other non-human primates and in humans, there's a replay of spatial information during REM sleep that almost precisely maps to the activity that we experienced during the day as we move from one place to another. So here's a common world scenario. You go to a new place, you navigate through that city or that environment. This place doesn't have to be at the scale of a city. It can be a new building.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode featuring Dr. Matthew Walker, the discussion revolves around the intricacies of sleep, its impact on health, and practical advice for improving sleep quality. Dr. Walker, a renowned sleep expert, delves into the reasons we sleep, the significance of dreams, and the effects of sleep deprivation on our waking lives. The conversation covers how various factors like light, temperature, diet, exercise, and even sex can influence sleep. They explore the science behind sleep cycles, including the importance of both REM and non-REM sleep, and how the balance between these stages shifts throughout the night. Dr. Walker also addresses common misconceptions about sleep aids such as alcohol and caffeine, explaining their actual effects on sleep architecture and quality. The episode underscores the importance of aligning our sleep habits with our biology to optimize health and performance.\nShow Guest: Dr. Matthew Walker\nTranscript: So coming back to just the point on REM sleep that you mentioned regarding emotional instability, and we see that, that's one of the things, one of the most reliable signatures of just insufficient sleep. It doesn't have to be sleep deprivation. What we've discovered over the past 20 years here at the Sleep Center is that there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find in which sleep is normal. And so I think that firstly told us there is a very intimate association between your emotional mental health and your sleep health. But when it also comes to REM sleep, I think what's fascinating is that it's not just about your emotional health. It's not just about your hormonal health. We've also been seeing other aspects of cognition. But then there was a report, I think it could have been about two years ago, out of Harvard. I think it was Beth Clearmond's group. They found that, and they replicated it in two different large populations. If you look at the contribution of different sleep stages to your lifespan, REM sleep was the strongest predictor of your longevity.\n------------------------\n"

He emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind protocols for enhancing various aspects of life, such as sleep, focus, and creativity. Huberman introduces the four major pillars of neurochemistry\u2014dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine\u2014which play crucial roles in focus, relaxation, sleep optimization, and exercise routines. He provides insights into recent studies on sleep and metabolism, highlighting the importance of experiencing different sleep states for metabolic health. The episode also covers strategies for shifting sleep schedules, especially for \"night owls,\" and the positive impacts on mental and physical health.

So acetylcholine is involved in focus and in learning, but it is not necessarily always associated with learning in the context of highly motivated, really ramped up states. It can be, but acetylcholine can also be released and can encourage the learning and neuroplasticity associated with calm states. For instance, if somebody has a newborn child, we know that they are flooded with oxytocin, which has actually even been called the love hormone, although it does many things in addition to control feelings of romantic attachment and attachment to children, et cetera. It does all of that, but it does a lot more as well. But when people have a new child, they also tend to be hyper-focused on that child, not just its wellbeing, but they narrow all their thinking, all their vision, all their hearing to that child. And there are obvious adaptive reasons for wanting to do that.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The episode \"Science of Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength & Muscular Recovery\" with Andrew Huberman delves into the mechanisms and best practices for muscle development, strength enhancement, and recovery. Huberman explains that muscle growth, or hypertrophy, and strength gains are not solely dependent on heavy weights but can be achieved through a range of resistance exercises at 30-80% of one's maximum capacity, with the key being to perform enough sets to near failure each week. He emphasizes the importance of the nervous system in directing muscle movement and growth, highlighting the Henneman size principle, which states that muscles recruit motor units from low to high threshold to conserve energy. Huberman also discusses the benefits of resistance training for hormonal responses, such as increasing testosterone, and the impact of lactate as a hormonal signal that can improve brain, heart, and liver function when exercising at high intensity. The episode underscores the importance of tailored resistance training for individual goals, whether for muscle size, strength, speed, or\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: I've talked before about acetylcholine in the brain, which is vitally important for focus and actually can gate neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. But in the neuromuscular system, acetylcholine released from motor neurons is the way, the only way that muscles can contract. Now there's another category of neurons in the spinal cord called central pattern generators or CPGs. And those are involved in rhythmic movements. Anytime we're walking or doing something where we don't have to think about it to do it deliberately, it's just happening reflexively, that central pattern generators and motor neurons. Anytime we're doing something deliberately, the top-down control, as we call it, from the upper motor neurons comes in and takes control of that system. So it's really simple. You've only got three ingredients. You've got the upper motor neurons, the lower motor neurons, and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive, you've also got the central pattern generators. So it's a terrifically simple system at that level.\n------------------------\n",

He explores how certain foods can enhance focus, overall brain health, and cognitive longevity. He delves into the subconscious signals from the gut that influence food choices, explaining that neurons in the gut send signals about nutrient content to the brain. Metabolic accessibility of food to the brain and belief about the health benefits of food also play roles in dietary preferences. Huberman emphasizes that one can change their diet to crave healthier foods through understanding these mechanisms. He also revisits the topic of time-restricted feeding, highlighting the importance of consistent eating windows for benefits like weight management and improved sleep and cognition. The episode also touches on the roles of various nutrients in brain health, including omega-3 fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, and choline, and how they contribute to neuron function and integrity.

I'll mention what those are in a moment, but acetylcholine as a neuromodulator tends to enhance the activity, the electrical activity and chemical activity of certain sets of neurons and downplay the activity of other neurons. So it's sort of a conductor of sorts leading to enhanced function and activity in certain brain areas and circuits and others. For instance, the brain areas that are involved in focus and alertness. We have multiple clusters of neurons in our brain that make acetylcholine. Two of the most prominent and well-known are the so-called nucleus basalis, which is a cluster of neurons deep in the basal forebrain that highlight particular areas of our brain, highlight meaning when acetylcholine is released from those neurons at their nerve endings in particular areas of the brain, those particular areas of the brain can undergo enhanced levels of activity relative to surrounding areas. So it's kind of a electrical highlighter pen, if you will, by analogy.\n------------------------\n"

As a matter of fact, if you take two different people, on average, they will have functional differences in 30% of their odor receptors. And if you do as Leslie Vossall and her colleagues did at Rockefeller University and give odor tests where they give people different things to smell and then they dilute them and find the threshold at which they can detect them, you find enormous changes from people to people, both in general terms. Some people are just better smellers than others. But in terms of individual odors as well, there's some odors that some people can't detect and other people smell one way. For example, there's a secreted hormone called androstenone. Androstenone, there are some people who can't smell it at all. For some people, it smells rather pleasant, like cut grass. And for some people, it smells foul, like urine or sweat. And it just depends on genetic variation in one particular odorant receptor. Sorry to interrupt.\n------------------------\n",

But individual variation is so important to our human experience and actually is so important to the process of evolution and natural selection and how species make their way in the world that it's something that requires a lot of attention. And to me, what's really fascinating is that when you look at the variation in the way sense organs function, it's almost a miracle that we can agree on a common reality at all, even within the human species. And this is true of some senses more than others. Obviously, in your world, in the retina, we have various kinds of loss of color vision that are well known, and some other more complicated phenomena having to do with impairments in the perception of motion or form. But the place where this really happens is in the olfactory system. So we have approximately 400 functional receptors for different odorant molecule smells in our nose.\n------------------------\n",

And we are very dependent upon them in terms of cultural context. And this can be learned. And this is central to our humanity in the sense that we humans are what I like to call the anti-pandas. Pandas live in one spot in southern China, and they eat one thing, bamboo, and that's it. Humans are the opposite. Humans can live in any ecological niche in the world from the tropics to the poles, and humans eat a wide, wide, wide variety of foods.

We're not talking about identity. Now, all of those things are extremely important, but the problem with things like ego protection and identity is that when we are faced with results that we don't want, and we are faced with those results in a real world context, like we're not getting the results we want in school, in work, in athletics, in relationships, et cetera, we hear these messages and we try to, for instance, you know, set our ego aside or, you know, not attach our identity so much to what is happening, but it's really, really hard. And it's really, really hard because statements like set your ego aside or don't attach yourself to it so much are wonderful aspirations, but there's no actual process that one can go through by oneself that allows you to immediately disentangle yourself from your ego, right?

On the other hand, I've given you this fairly specific recommendation based on the Galpin equation that you should ingest your body weight in pounds divided by 30. That's how many ounces of fluid you should drink every 15 minutes, which I'm guessing for most people is going to be more fluid than they're currently drinking on average. And so how could it be that you can have a recommendation for what's optimal that's different than the amount that you would reflexively drink?

And the reason that loss of water from our system impacts mental capacity and physical performance has a lot to do with literally the changes in the volume of those cells, the size of those cells, based on how much sodium is contained in or outside those cells. And something that I've alluded to before on the podcast, and I'll talk about more in a moment, which is that neurons signal to one another by way of electricity through something called the action potential, and that actually requires sodium and potassium and magnesium. So the Galpin equation suggests that we start exercise hydrated with electrolytes, not just with water. So that means water that has some sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

I'm not going to speak for Andy, for Dr. Galpin, but I think he would probably agree that these are averages to shoot for and that unless you're hyperneurotic, the idea is to make sure that you're entering the activity, cognitive or physical, sufficiently hydrated, and that throughout that activity, you're hydrating regularly.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode featuring Dr. Craig Heller, the discussion centers on the science of thermoregulation and its impact on human performance and health. Dr. Heller explains how the body manages heat and the importance of maintaining homeostasis. The conversation delves into how controlling core body temperature can significantly enhance both mental and physical performance in various environments. Dr. Heller also debunks myths about the best ways to cool down, emphasizing that common practices like placing a cold pack on the neck may actually impede heat loss. The episode touches on the potential of discussing Dr. Heller's work on Down syndrome and circadian rhythms in future episodes. Overall, the episode provides insights into optimizing human biology and performance through temperature regulation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Craig Heller\nTranscript: And typically anabolic steroids are of the testosterone variety. There are derivatives, et cetera, and those derivatives do different things and anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. But typically the idea is, at least as I understand it in talking to some of these individuals, is that they allow people to train more because they recover faster. They are able to synthesize more protein because they're basically getting a second puberty. Because as we all know, during puberty, there's a lot of growth of the body. And of course, there are a lot of negative effects of abuse of these things. and they are banned from various sports organizations. Especially, I should mention, in combat sports, this is especially concerning because in combat sports, a performance enhancement means that you can harm somebody more than you would be able to otherwise, as opposed to in other sorts of sports, just to conceptualize it. And I'm not taking a moral stance on any of this. I just want to ask you, when you compare Palmer cooling to anabolic steroids in terms of gym performance, what do you see?\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The episode \"Science of Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength & Muscular Recovery\" with Andrew Huberman delves into the mechanisms and best practices for muscle development, strength enhancement, and recovery. Huberman explains that muscle growth, or hypertrophy, and strength gains are not solely dependent on heavy weights but can be achieved through a range of resistance exercises at 30-80% of one's maximum capacity, with the key being to perform enough sets to near failure each week. He emphasizes the importance of the nervous system in directing muscle movement and growth, highlighting the Henneman size principle, which states that muscles recruit motor units from low to high threshold to conserve energy. Huberman also discusses the benefits of resistance training for hormonal responses, such as increasing testosterone, and the impact of lactate as a hormonal signal that can improve brain, heart, and liver function when exercising at high intensity. The episode underscores the importance of tailored resistance training for individual goals, whether for muscle size, strength, speed, or\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: I'm not responsible for your health. You are, I don't say that just to protect me. I would say that also to protect you, but it really seems to improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue. There are even some interesting effects on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass. So creatine, beta alanine, electrolytes, these are kind of the core three things that seem to improve performance and are well supported by the scientific literature. And in the earlier episode on supercharging performance, we talked about Palmer cooling. That's certainly a performance enhancing tool. It's nothing you ingest. You're cooling your palms in a very specific way. That's very powerful. Now, what about for longer duration bouts of exercise? We've mainly been focusing on resistance training, but what about for long runs, long swims, these kinds of things? Well, it does seem that beet juice and ingesting things like arginine and citrulline can improve performance for those long bouts of exercise. That's mainly going to be due to effects of those compounds on vasodilation.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode 66, hosted by Dr. Andrew Huberman, delves into the science and application of deliberate cold exposure for enhancing health and performance. The episode discusses how cold exposure affects the nervous system and various organs, and how it can be utilized to improve mental health, physical health, athletic performance, and cognitive function. Huberman explains the importance of understanding cold's impact on the brain and body, and outlines specific protocols for cold exposure using variables like temperature, duration, and method (e.g., showers, baths, or environmental exposure). He emphasizes the potency of temperature as a stimulus and the associated risks if not approached correctly, advising listeners to consult a physician before starting new protocols. The episode also discusses a study on the benefits of moderate aerobic exercise before cognitive tasks, suggesting that exercise can enhance focus and perceptual speed more effectively than mindfulness meditation. Huberman concludes by highlighting the importance of gradual progression in cold exposure practices and finding the minimum effective stimulus for maximum benefit.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And that raises perhaps the most important point, which is the way that Palmer cooling can improve performance by way of reducing core body temperature is known. And that is because when one engages in exercise or muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there.\n------------------------\n"

So you're worried about getting COVID or you're worried about some other physical problem you have and you notice it in your body, your body tenses up, you start to sweat, the sympathetic nervous system goes, your heart rate goes up. And when you notice that, you think, oh God, this is really bad. And then you feel worse. So it's like a snowball rolling downhill. And then you feel worse and then your body gets worse.

He's in that same mental state. People go into dissociative states when they're traumatized. So in a way, hypnosis is helping them remember and deal with the memories better because they're more in the mental state that is more like what happened. And most rape victims will tell you, I was floating above my body feeling sorry for the woman being assaulted below. People in traumatic episodes, they just say, you know, I blank out. I don't know what's happening. I'm on autopilot. And that's a kind of self-hypnotic state. So when you use hypnosis to help them deal with a traumatic memory, you're making the state they're in right there in your office with you more congruent to the state they were likely in when the trauma happened.

There are a lot of cases where if you neglect a baby, you neglect an adolescent or a teenager, development doesn't go well. And we'll touch on some of those, but those are really extreme cases. They're sort of like the parallel to experiments that are often done in the laboratory with animals, where you've probably heard of these enriched environments where they'll give mice a bunch of toys and they'll give them some different foods every once in a while and they'll house them together with other mice.

And this starts with infant and mother or infant and father. I talked a little bit about this in the previous episode, but just to remind you, or for anyone that didn't hear about it, that during development, healthy emotional development clearly begins with an ability for the caretaker and child to be in calm, peaceful, soothing, touch-oriented, eye-gazing type of behaviors. Those really drive serotonin, the endogenous opioid system, oxytocin, things that are very calming and are centered around pleasure with the here and now, as well as excited states of what we're going to do next. There's actually a kind of characteristic sign of the dopaminergic interaction where both caretaker and child are wide-eyed. The pupils dilate, that's a signature of arousal. They get really excited.

So how would this work in the real world context? Well, I think any child or adolescent or person younger than 25 that's taken these drugs has no doubt achieved some level of neuroplasticity of the neural circuits related to all the things we call focus. And I want to be very clear. There's no single brain area or set of brain circuits for what I'm referring to as focus, because after all, focus involves task switching, focus involves all sorts of different cognitive operations, depending on what we're focusing on, right? The focusing on a sport is basically a practice of directing one's attention in different locations at different moments. Focusing on studying is an entirely different pattern of focus altogether. But the point being, if a person 25 years or younger takes a drug that increases dopamine and norepinephrine and assuming that things are working, meaning the dose is right, they're achieving better ability to focus, et cetera, those circuits are going to get stronger.\n------------------------\n"

This is thought to come about through the lactate pathways of the gut that can then impact the brain. If you want to look more into this issue of whether or not probiotics taken in excess perhaps can lead to brain fog, I'd encourage you to look at a particular paper. This is a paper published in Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology. And the title of the paper is Brain Fogginess, Gas and Bloating, a Link Between SIBO, Probiotics, and Metabolic Acidosis. It was published in 2018. We can provide a link to this study. And there are several other studies in the references that point to the fact that in some cases, excessive intake of probiotics and excessive proliferation of gut microbiota can actually be problematic. I mentioned this not to confuse you, but because it is confusing out there.

If they're taken ongoing, not for short periods of time, but if they're taken ongoing, can lead to some issues like brain fog. There's a nice literature on this and a growing one at that. So my suggestion is that if people are going to take supplements to support the microbiome, that those supplements include low enough levels, that is small enough amounts of prebiotics and probiotics that you don't start to venture into the realm of brain fog and some of the other issues that could be associated with taking too much prebiotic and probiotic in the form of supplements.

Additionally, he touches on the use of supplements like L-tyrosine and 5-HTP for influencing dopamine and serotonin levels, respectively, and the potent mood-regulating effects of omega-3 fatty acids. The episode is grounded in scientific research and aims to equip listeners with\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: First of all, supporting a healthy gut microbiome is good for mood, great for digestion, and great for immune system function. However, that does not mean maxing out or taking the most probiotic and prebiotic that you can possibly manage. As I mentioned many times before, I do believe in probiotics. I take probiotics, but there are studies that show that if you take lots and lots of certain probiotics like lactobacillus and you really ramp up the levels more, it is not a case of more is better. There are things like brain fog that can come from that. Brain fog is just this inability to focus. People feel really not well generally. Some of those studies are a little bit controversial, but I think it's fair to say that if people really increase the amount of probiotic that they're taking beyond a certain amount, then they start feeling foggy in the mind. Now, what's too much? Well, I get probiotics from, I've mentioned before, from athletic greens. You can get them from fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, natto. These are different sources from around the world.\n------------------------\n"

Okay, so how do we interpret this? Does this mean that when you eat something that's very savory or very sweet, for instance, that it's triggering activation of the ovaries or of the testes? Well, it's possible. Now, how those molecules, those chemical molecules would actually get there isn't clear. The digestive tract does not run directly to the testes or to the ovaries. But nonetheless, what this means is that chemical sensing of the very things that we detect on our tongue and that we call taste in quotes in food is also evoking cellular responses within the reproductive gonads. Now, whether or not this underlies the positive association that we have with certain foods isn't clear, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the obvious, which is that the relationship between the sensual nature of particular foods and sensuality generally, and the reproductive axis is something that's been covered in many movies.\n------------------------\n",

But in general, it's the sweet and the savory. Rarely is it the sour or the bitter, the salty or the fat. And not surprisingly, perhaps, it is the T2Rs and the T1Rs, the receptors that are associated with the sweet and with the umami, the savory flavors that are expressed not just on the tongue and in portions of the digestive tract, but on the gonads themselves. So what does this mean? Does this mean that eating certain foods can stimulate the gonads? Maybe. There's no data that immediately support that right now, but this is an emerging area. If you'd like to read more about this, there's a great review entitled Taste Perception from the Tongue to the Testes, although they do also talk about the ovaries. Why they didn't include that in the title is I think a reflection of the bias of the author.\n------------------------\n",

There's a very interesting paper published in Molecular Human Reproduction. You can find it easily online. It's downloadable. I'll also provide a link to it. I just think it's fascinating that these taste receptors are expressed in other tissues. And I should mention that they're expressed in tissues of other areas of the body as well, including the respiratory system, but the richest aggregation or concentration of these receptors for umami and sweet, of course, is on the tongue, but also on the gonads. And I think it does speak to the possible bridge between what we think of as a sensory or a sensual experience of food and the deeper kind of visceral sense within the gut and maybe even within the gonads as well of something that we find extremely pleasurable or even appetitive that we want to move toward it. We're actually going to return to that general theme in the discussion about touch sensation. Some people, for instance, when they touch certain surfaces like furs or sheepskins or velvet or soft, smooth surfaces, it feels good elsewhere in their body, not just at the point of contact with that surface.\n------------------------\n"

In order to illustrate just how powerfully our biology can shape our perception of the attractiveness of other people, I want to share with you the results of a couple of studies. Both studies explore how people rate other people's attractiveness. And in both studies, the major variable is that women are at different stages of their menstrual cycle. Now, in the first study, men are rating the attractiveness of women according to the smell of those women. Now they're not smelling them directly. They're smelling clothing that women wore for a couple of days at different phases of their menstrual cycle.\n------------------------\n",

And when I hear meaningful, I hear they tend to push the autonomic nervous system and neurochemical systems of the brain and body in a direction that makes us feel good as opposed to lousy or neutral. In any event, this study looked at whether or not people have high levels of self-expansion through the actions or statements of their significant other and how that influences their perception of people outside the relationship, meaning how attractive they perceive people outside the relationship to be, turns out to be strongly influenced by A, whether or not their self-expansion is very strongly driven by the other person that they are involved with, that they're in the romantic relationship with, and whether or not that's being expressed to them. So here's how the study went. First of all, they rated or categorized individuals on the basis of the self-expansion metric.

Dr. Gillett also touches on the importance of understanding individual differences in hormone health, including genetic factors and the effects of certain medications and supplements. The conversation delves into the mechanisms of hormone function and offers specific protocols for hormone health across different stages of life for both men and women.\nShow Guest: Dr. Kyle Gillett\nTranscript: Given that you work with human beings and they have lives and relationships and lifestyles, and they have hormones and all these things interact, what are some of the ways that we could think about adjusting our relationships in order to optimize hormones, as opposed to just thinking about how to optimize hormones for sake of our relationship, because it's bi-directional, of course. And this assumes, I should say, that one is already paying attention to the six pillars talked about earlier, that people are doing most things right. How should we think about relationships and hormones? Friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, long-term partners. How do you think about this kind of stuff? Yeah. So if you have a new partner, then it is largely regulated by the dopaminergic system, which changes over time. So people may have heard the saying that you have to go through a full calendar year with someone that you're in a relationship so that you- Very good advice, by the way.

Huberman delves into the unique neural pathways for different types of relationships\u2014parental, friendships, romantic\u2014and how they are affected by events like breakups or loss. The episode also covers the role of neurochemicals like oxytocin and dopamine in social bonding and the genetic factors influencing social behaviors. Huberman emphasizes that regardless of one's social situation, understanding and nurturing social bonds is universally important. He highlights that the episode will provide actionable tools for enhancing social connections, particularly during the holiday season, and will offer insights into the neurobiology of introversion and extroversion, social media behaviors, and the pain of social separation.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: We are also going to talk about the neurochemicals and hormones that underlie their function.

And should you not be spending time with family members and friends, today we are also going to talk about how to achieve social bonds out of the context of family and romantic partnership and friendship. So today's episode is going to include a lot of science, a lot of actionable tools, and I'm confident that you will come away from today's episode with tremendous knowledge about how you function. For instance, if you're an introvert or an extrovert, why is that? Turns out there may be a neurochemical basis for that. Maybe you're somebody that really enjoys social media. Maybe you're somebody that doesn't.

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode featuring Dr. Maya Shankar, the discussion revolves around the concepts of identity, goals, and the interplay between the two. Dr. Shankar, a cognitive scientist with a diverse background that includes a career-ending injury as a violinist, shares insights on how such life-altering events can force a reevaluation of one's identity and goals. The conversation delves into the cognitive science behind identity formation, the impact of early experiences and external expectations, and the importance of aligning goals with deeper motivations rather than superficial achievements. Dr. Shankar emphasizes the value in anchoring identity to the reasons behind our actions, rather than the actions themselves, and provides practical advice for navigating change and rediscovering passion in new endeavors. The episode aims to equip listeners with a science-supported roadmap for assessing and shaping their identity and goals to become the person they aspire to be.\nShow Guest: Dr. Maya Shankar\nTranscript: Not on today's podcast, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.

            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode on \"The Science of MDMA & Its Therapeutic Uses: Benefits & Risks\" explores the chemical properties, neurobiological effects, and potential therapeutic applications of MDMA, particularly for treating PTSD. MDMA, distinct from other psychedelics and stimulants, acts as an empathogen, increasing both dopamine and serotonin, which enhances social connectivity and empathy. Clinical trials have shown promising results for MDMA-assisted therapy in PTSD treatment, with changes in brain function and connectivity correlating with symptom relief. However, MDMA remains a Schedule I drug and is illegal to possess or sell in the U.S. The episode also discusses MDMA's history, its path to potential legality, and the differences between recreational and therapeutic use. Lastly, it addresses concerns about MDMA's neurotoxicity, exploring how therapeutic use may avoid toxicity, and the ongoing debate about its long-term effects.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Many people have perhaps heard of the book, The Body Keeps the Score, which is a very successful and popular book about the idea that trauma can be quote unquote stored in the body. To be clear, traumas can't actually be stored in the body. You don't actually store memories in the body. What you store are activation of neural circuits that include brain and body, and they all seem to center back into the insula, that structure that we talked about earlier, this structure in our brain that has a map of our body surface. So contrary to popular belief, we don't store memories in the body or trauma in the body in a way that for instance, working out a knot or a pain in one's lower back will relieve the trauma. It sometimes can activate a memory of the trauma, but when one is doing that, what you're really doing is activating neural circuits that reside within the brain, within the insula, that correspond to sensations within the body. Now, I don't want to diminish the role of the body in the formation and the persistence of PTSD. And I certainly think the book, The Body Keeps the Score, is a pioneering book.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode \"A Science-Supported Journaling Protocol to Improve Mental & Physical Health,\" Andrew Huberman discusses a specific form of journaling that has been scientifically validated to enhance mental and physical well-being. This method, supported by over 200 peer-reviewed studies, involves writing about the most emotionally challenging experiences of one's life. The process entails writing continuously for 15-30 minutes over four sessions, which can be done in consecutive days or once a week for a month. This journaling technique is linked to improved immunity, reduced symptoms of autoimmune disorders, better sleep, lower anxiety, and enhanced cognitive functions like memory and decision-making. The practice involves deep emotional engagement, which may initially increase distress, but ultimately leads to lasting positive benefits. The protocol's effectiveness is attributed to its ability to foster a coherent narrative around stressful or traumatic experiences, thus promoting neuroplastic changes in the brain, particularly increased activity in the prefrontal cortex.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, there's a whole discussion to be had about this, and we will have that discussion in a future episode of the podcast about how trauma is actually mapped within the brain and body. There are a lot of theories about this, right? Sometimes we hear that it's all mapped within the body. Sometimes we hear it's all mapped within the brain. Turns out, as is almost always the case, it's both. But there does seem to be both neuroscience-based and psychology, both clinical and research psychology-based evidence for the idea that when people experience very stressful and traumatic events, that the representation of those events is somewhat fractured in the sense that people, by not talking about them, by not creating a coherent narrative around them, start to form false correlations between the kind of stress that they create in our body and mind when we think about them and a confusion about what happened, a confusion about why we feel terrible when maybe we weren't the perpetrator or create a sort of lack of coherence between our bodily state and what we're thinking, especially because we're not the perpetrator, right? Here we're talking about traumas and stressful things that happened to us.\n------------------------\n",

And he defines trauma as any experience or experiences, plural, that modify our brain and neural circuitry. So it could be brain or body or both, such that we do not function as well emotionally, behaviorally, or cognitively going forward from that experience. Okay, so not everything constitutes a trauma, but many things do. So applying that definition, I think it's fair to say that many, if not most people, have some form of trauma stored in their nervous system. And other people perhaps don't have such traumas, but everyone has had stressors. In fact, I think it's fair to say that everyone has had major stressors in their life, provided that they've lived it all. That's just part of life, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately. Maybe it makes us who we are in positive ways if we are able to transmute those negative experiences and stressors or traumas into particular forms of learning that allow us to do better. And indeed that's possible. And that was discussed with Paul Conti in that four episode series on mental health.\n------------------------\n"

You know, things like cannabis, right, decreases sperm production, decreases sperm motility, changes sperm morphology, the shape of it, changes the DNA, increases the fragmentation of the DNA. If your partner uses cannabis and you get pregnant, you have a higher chance of miscarriage because of the sperm association with the cannabis. Now- Edible cannabis as well as smoked cannabis. I don't know, right? Because you can't study something that's illegal. So a lot of this data is just more new and a lot of it's going to be observational. And in states like Colorado and California where cannabis is essentially legal, I'm assuming there are more data.

            "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"How to Optimize Fertility in Males & Females,\" Andrew Huberman discusses the biological processes and factors influencing fertility for both sexes. He explains the importance of understanding fertility for everyone, not just those looking to conceive, as it relates to overall vitality and longevity. Huberman delves into the menstrual cycle in females, describing its orchestration for potential fertilization and its impact on brain and body behavior. For males, he discusses spermatogenesis and the journey sperm take to reach and fertilize the egg. The episode also covers actionable tools for enhancing fertility, including behavioral changes, nutrition, supplementation, and medical interventions for hormone or neurotransmitter production issues. Huberman emphasizes that knowledge of fertility processes can contribute to maximizing health and lifespan, regardless of one's desire to have children.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: This greatly disrupts the quality of the egg at the level of the spindle and mitochondria and a number of other features. And in the sperm, it turns out that smoking doesn't necessarily disrupt the sperm directly, although it can cause DNA fragmentation, which can cause all sorts of abnormalities, can prevent fertilization, can lead to birth defects in the offspring. But more importantly, it increases what are called reactive oxygen species in the seminal fluid, in the semen that contain the sperm. This very, under normal circumstances, under healthy circumstances, beautifully orchestrated chemistry of fluid that allows the sperm to thrive in their trajectory and attempt to fertilize the egg and lead to a healthy pregnancy. So if you are a smoker and you want to conceive, the best advice I can give you is to quit smoking. And yes, that includes cannabis as well. Now, I am not somebody who believes that cannabis across the board is not useful. There are medical applications and other applications. I talk about that in an episode all about cannabis for health and disease, and notice health was in there too.\n------------------------\n"

I don't want to hit the walls. So therefore, I'm going to try to improve the accuracy in which I throw the ball. So I want to make sure that I'm throwing it down the center of the lane more often. And I want to get my standard deviation tighter and tighter so that I don't get anywhere close to hitting the wall. However, what they're not realizing is if you do that, the body will start shrinking the size of the lane. Because what it basically says is, huh, we haven't had a ball touch us in years.

So your two strategies for enhancing recovery are to practice getting closer, throwing that ball down the middle of the lane, or to widen, to widen the alley. And that's exactly what you're referring to. And you absolutely should do that. And so what happens is you don't have to be so precise with what you're doing because your ability to handle so many things is widened. So if you're off now by four or five inches to the right, no problem because you've just tripled the size of your alley. That's exactly what you want to do. So paying attention to two things. Number one is getting better at accuracy, maybe staying really tight with your progressions, using nutrition and sleep to optimize your recovery and push your resilience is what we call this. In fact, there's actually a biological way to measure resilience. We do that in all of our folks. This is scientifically validated stuff. I didn't just make it up.

They emphasize that while hydration and whole food nutrition lay the foundation for good health, there are circumstances where supplementation can be beneficial. Dr. Galpin highlights that supplements can be consumed in high concentrations not typically found in nature, which can have significant effects on performance and recovery. However, he cautions against over-supplementation, as it can be unproductive or even harmful. He advocates for precision supplementation based on individual biological testing to provide only what is necessary for each person. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Galpin also discuss creatine as a top supplement due to its wide-ranging benefits for muscle performance, cognitive function, and potential impacts on bone density and neurological health. They stress the importance of consistent supplementation over time to raise baseline functioning and improve resilience. The conversation includes a detailed look at hydration strategies and the potential consequences of both dehydration and overhydration.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Whether we talked about food or hydration, or I think I gave you the example of cyanide naturally occurring in your food, hot water is the same way. So if you are under hydrated or dehydrated, then there is a clear negative effect on your body. And as I increase the level or improve the level of hydration, things get better, whether this is physical performance or whether this is mental performance. In fact, we know that a body weight reduction of as low as 2% via dehydration. So imagine you're doing a bout of exercise and you're sweating and you lose 2% of your body weight. That alone is enough to reduce accuracy and performance. So the classic study we talk about here was in basketball players. So shooting accuracy. So free throw shooting, I think is specifically what they looked at. Significant reduction in performance with as little as 2% dehydration. At that level, you also see a significant increase in perception of difficulty of exercise. And so only right at 2%. And again, when I say 2%, I mean percent body weight lost, right? That's what that means.\n------------------------\n"

It will take those freshly minted memories and it will consolidate them into the brain, meaning that it will start to fixate them, almost like sort of setting them in concrete into the brain. And so you are far less likely to lose those memories, which is to say you are far less likely to forget if you've been sleeping after you've learned. It's not just that though. Sleep does more than simply strengthen those individual memories. Sleep will start to cross-link and connect those memories together. And as a consequence, the next day you will wake up and that memory back catalog has now been updated with all of the recent information and it's integrated and it's associated. So you are now able to come up with new creative solutions to issues or problems that you've been facing because you've updated what we call the associative networks in your brain.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode 72 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the science of memory and how to improve it using science-based tools. He explains that memory is not just about learning, but also about placing life events into context, linking immediate experiences with past and future ones. Huberman promises to make the science accessible and discusses specific protocols grounded in extensive research that can enhance learning and memory. The episode also touches on unlearning and forgetting, providing tools to reduce the emotional weight of negative experiences. Additionally, he covers topics like deja vu, photographic memory, and how to use the visual system to improve memory. Huberman emphasizes that these insights are based on a solid understanding of brain systems and are separate from his roles at Stanford, aligning with his mission to distribute zero-cost consumer information about science.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: It is still true that the strengthening of connections in the brain, the literal neuroplasticity, the changing of the circuits occurs during deep sleep and non-sleep deep rest. And it is also true, and I've mentioned these results earlier, that two papers were published in Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal over the last few years showing that brief naps of about 20 to up to 90 minutes in some period of time after an attempt to learn can enhance the rate of learning and memory. However, those bouts of sleep, the deep sleep that night, I should say, or those brief naps, or even the so-called NSDR, as we call it, non-sleep deep rest that was used to enhance the learning and memory of particular pieces of information, either cognitive or physical information or both, that still can be performed, but it can be performed some hours later, even an hour later. It can be performed two hours later, four hours later. Remember, it's in these naps and in deep sleep that the actual reconfiguration of the neural circuits occurs, the strengthening of those neural circuits occurs.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Learn Skills Faster,\" Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford, discusses the neuroscience of skill acquisition and how to optimize learning. He emphasizes the importance of errors in the learning process, as they signal the brain to focus attention and open up opportunities for neuroplasticity. Huberman advises maximizing repetitions during practice sessions and allowing the brain to rest afterward to consolidate learning. He also debunks the notion that slow movements are best for beginners, suggesting that they are more beneficial once some proficiency is achieved. Huberman touches on the use of metronomes for advanced learners to increase the pace and number of repetitions. He concludes that the key to faster skill learning is to perform many repetitions, pay attention to errors, and allow for periods of rest post-practice for the brain to process and consolidate the new skills.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And it involves doing exactly as I just described, which is getting as many repetitions as you can in the learning session, paying attention to the errors that you make, and then the rewards that will be generated, again, these are neurochemical rewards, from the successful performance of a movement or the approximate successful performance. So maybe you get the golf swing better, but not perfect, but that's still going to be rewarded with this neurochemical mechanism. And then after the session, you need to do something very specific, which is nothing. That's right. There are beautiful data describing neurons in our hippocampus, this area of our brain involved in the consolidation of new memories. Those data point to the fact that in sleep, there's a replay of the sequence of neurons that were involved in certain behaviors the previous day, and sometimes the previous day before that. However, there are also data that show that after a skill learning session, any kind of motor movement, provided you're not bringing in a lot more additional new sensory stimuli, there's a replay of the motor sequence that you performed correctly, and there's an elimination of the motor sequences that you performed incorrectly, and they are run backward in time, okay?\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Poe's research highlights the importance of consistent sleep timing for growth hormone release, which is crucial for overall health. Disruptions in sleep patterns can lead to missed growth hormone release windows, impacting vitality and longevity. The conversation also explores the role of sleep in memory consolidation, particularly how REM sleep contributes to emotional memory processing and creativity. Additionally, Dr. Poe discusses the locus coeruleus, a brain region that modulates attention and learning, and its reduced activity during REM sleep, which is necessary for memory consolidation and emotional regulation. The episode emphasizes the significance of quality sleep for mental and physical health and provides actionable steps to improve sleep habits.\nShow Guest: Dr. Gina Poe\nTranscript: So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep in terms of learning and memory, the importance of the structure of the 90-minute cycle for all of that. So you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed by too much locus or ilus activity, the structure and the function of those sleep spindles and that theta during REM sleep and the lack of norepinephrine, all of those structures, all those functions for learning something new, like a new behavior that doesn't involve the drugs, becomes compromised. And so that's something that Tanya Lugos, in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA, that we're looking at.

Dr. Spiegel discusses the benefits of hypnosis in treating stress, anxiety, chronic pain, and various illnesses, emphasizing the difference between clinical hypnosis and stage hypnosis. Clinical hypnosis involves entering a unique brain state to make beneficial adjustments to mind and body, while stage hypnosis is more about entertainment. Dr. Spiegel explains that hypnosis can rapidly induce changes, which can be long-lasting, and that not everyone is equally susceptible to hypnosis. He introduces a simple test to assess hypnotizability and shares insights from his research on how hypnosis affects brain activity.

Most of those are geared toward improving the extraocular eye muscles.

And he agreed that a smooth pursuit stimulus, that kind of training, as well as, or exercise, as well as near far. So spending a few minutes, you might even just do this for two minutes of looking at something up close, that's going to activate these accommodation mechanisms, and then moving it at arm's length and focusing on it for five, 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe 15 or 20 seconds, then slowly moving it into a location and then out.\n------------------------\n",

So I had to spend at least three years of 10 minutes a day, it's what I recommend, doing near far, covering up my good eye, doing near far with my bad eye, and now it's been about 10, 12 years that I have pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many of you aren't dealing with this or have these early childhood issues. Some of you might be experiencing challenges with fatigued eyes or with differences in focus with the two eyes. These eye exercises of near far, smooth pursuit and checking for dominant and non-dominant eye can be very beneficial. Again, I'm not a clinician, so I don't want to give you protocols or enforce protocols on anybody. You need to figure out what's right and safe for you, given your vision history. I do recommend talking to a really good ophthalmologist if you have severe vision problems of any kind, or if you want to offset vision problems of any kind, an optometrist as well, but ideally it would be a neuro-ophthalmologist.

He delves into how these senses are deeply linked to memory, emotions, and subconscious biological processes. Huberman discusses the mechanisms of olfaction (smell), the different types of odors, and how certain smells can modulate our biology, including hormone levels. He also explains how the act of sniffing can enhance cognition and outlines practical sniffing exercises to improve one's sense of smell and taste. The episode further covers the potential sixth taste sense for fat, and the relationship between the tongue, digestion, and the gut-brain axis. Huberman emphasizes the importance of these senses for survival, such as detecting energy sources or avoiding toxins, and how they can be trained and maintained for better health and brain function.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Before we dive into chemical sensing, I want to just briefly touch on a few things from the vision episode. One is a summary of a protocol. So I covered 13 protocols last episode. If you haven't seen that episode, check it out. Those protocols will allow you to be more alert and to see better over time if you follow them. All of them are zero cost. You can find any and all of them at hubermanlab.com. There's a link to those videos and tools and protocols. Everything is timestamped. The two protocols that I just want to remind everybody of are the protocol of near-far viewing that all of us, regardless of age, should probably spend about five minutes, three times a week doing some near-far viewing exercises. So that would be bringing a pen or pencil up close to the point where you're about to cross your eyes, but you don't cross your eyes, and then out at some distance, and then look beyond that pen or other object that you're using off as far as you can into the distance.\n------------------------\n"

Again, the criteria for BP2 bipolar II is these four days or less of mania or hypomania, but only 4% of the time or 5% of the time is a small enough sliver of the pie that is these people's existence that you can imagine why it would be easy for them or other people to overlook the fact that they have bipolar disorder and not major depression. Think about it. This is a person who, or I should say a collection of people who are spending about half of their time depressed, close to half, 45% of their time symptom-free, and then about 5% of their time in a hypomanic state.

Before we move into a in-depth discussion about the different kinds of treatments for bipolar disorder, I'd like to touch on just a few additional aspects of what bipolar disorder can do in terms of its negative consequences, and also talk about some of the inherited risk, that is the genetic factors and the environmental factors that can contribute to bipolar disorder. In terms of the burden, the very real emotional and occupational and educational burden that can occur for somebody with bipolar disorder, that's actually been studied. There's a measure of this, it's called global burden, which is defined as the years lost in engaging in normal life due to some disability.

He explains that happiness is a sought-after state that most people cannot precisely define, yet recognize when experienced. Huberman introduces the concept of operational definitions, which are agreed-upon terms for abstract concepts like happiness, and acknowledges the difficulty in scientifically pinning down such a subjective emotion.\n\nThe episode focuses on three main topics: defining happiness as a brain state and a state of mind and body, tools and practices for achieving states of happiness, and misconceptions and contradictions in happiness research. Huberman challenges the common belief that happiness only comes from external achievements, introducing the idea of synthesized happiness, which involves concrete steps and is potentially more powerful than externally driven happiness. He also discusses the contradictions between common advice for achieving happiness and the realities of life's pressures, such as the balance between work, social connections, and self-care.\n\nHuberman aims to provide a framework\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: David Spiegel at Stanford Department of Psychiatry has shown that even briefer meditations of even just five minutes per day can have fairly outsized positive effects on a number of different parameters as well. Those very brief types of meditations, because they really are focusing and more accurately, I should say, refocusing exercises, when you do that sort of activity of closing your eyes and forcing yourself to focus and refocus on your breath and internal state, that is directing your perception inward, or if you choose, you could deliberately focus your perception on some external object or sound for that matter. When one does that, the circuits of the brain involved in focus dramatically improve, that is they rewire and increase their ability for you to achieve focus. Many of us have heard about meditation. Many of us think about meditation as a mindfulness exercise, mindfulness in quotes, because that itself needs definition. But I prefer to view meditations of the sort that I just described as perceptual or focus-based training, which is really what the data point to.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode #96 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the science behind meditation, how it affects the brain and body, and how it can be tailored to individual needs and goals. He explains that meditation practices can range from focusing on the third eye center, body scanning, or even walking meditations, and that they fundamentally alter our state of being not just during the practice but afterward as well. Huberman emphasizes the importance of selecting a meditation that aligns with one's personal objectives, such as enhancing focus, improving sleep, or managing mood. He also debunks the myth that more meditation is better, explaining that as one's meditation practice deepens, the less one might need to meditate to experience its benefits. The episode promises to equip listeners with a variety of meditation techniques, an understanding of their mechanisms, and guidance on adapting practices to fit changing circumstances or goals.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: I've talked about this previously in the podcast, but in that very study from Wendy Suzuki's lab showing that 13 minute a day meditation is beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera, it's also very clear that for a number of people that do that typical third eye meditation for 13 minutes a day, if they do that too close to sleep or when they want to go to sleep, they have a hard time falling asleep, which makes perfect sense because they are becoming more interoceptively aware. They are ramping up their level of focus. A meditation practice typically is a focus and refocus practice. And falling asleep involves turning off your thoughts and your focus and focusing purely on sensation. And then your thoughts kind of fragment and you drift off to sleep. This is why I'm a big fan of using non-sleep deep rest or yoga nidra. We will provide links to non-sleep deep rest and yoga nidra protocols. I've talked about them on the podcast before, but those protocols are not meditation per se. They tend to have people defocus. They are anti-focus practices, whereas meditation tends to be a focusing practice.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: I've tried this meditation. It's actually quite fun to do because at least to me, it feels a lot easier than the meditation associated with convergent thinking. Now, the convergent thinking meditation is the so-called focus attention meditation. And that's also described in the same study and other studies have explored which particular brain networks it involves. And I can just tell you that focused attention meditation, which you can think of, or I'd prefer that you think of just as a perceptual exercise, involves sitting or lying down, closing your eyes, focusing either on your breath or some element of your body, could be the tops of your knees or the clasp of your hands. It could be focusing on an auditory tone. You could even do it eyes open and stare at a point on a wall or a flame of light. Whatever it happens to be that allows you to redirect your focus to a particular location or idea or sound, that is known to improve your ability to engage convergent thinking, to quickly parse through or analyze a bunch of different choices and to persist in choice selection and therefore more rapidly arrive at the correct answer. This is well-established.\n------------------------\n"

Now, there are a lot of things that are different about these super agers, super agers in the sense that they are maintaining very youthful levels of cognition. But one of the things that's become very apparent from the neuroimaging data is that super agers maintain a volume, a size of the anterior mid-singulate cortex that is significantly greater than their age-matched cohorts. So the exciting thing is that there are many, many lines of evidence pointing to the fact that the anterior mid-singulate cortex at least has something to do with our ability to generate tenacity and willpower. And that it, when active, moves us up that continuum away from apathy and depression toward states of being able to engage in or resist particular types of behaviors.\n------------------------\n",

            "\nShow Summary: During a live Q&A event in Melbourne, Dr. Andrew Huberman discussed the brain-body connection and answered audience questions on various topics. He emphasized the importance of cardiovascular exercise, particularly zone two cardio, for brain health due to its role in promoting blood circulation and releasing growth factors. Huberman also touched on the role of dopamine in preventing age-related cognitive decline and speculated on the future use of pharmacology to enhance cognitive function. Additionally, he explored the anterior mid-cingulate cortex's involvement in willpower and the potential of non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for mental and physical rejuvenation. The event also covered the impact of shift work on circadian rhythms, and Huberman suggested strategies like reducing blue light exposure at night and adjusting sleep schedules. Finally, he addressed the audience's questions on topics like psychedelics, childhood trauma, consciousness, genetics, the microbiome, and female hormones, highlighting the need for more research and a collective effort in public science communication.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Anyway, the anterior mid-singulate cortex seems to be hyperactive in these super-agers, as they're called. And so it seems that not only do they maintain cognitive function later in life, but that seems to be related to their regular engagement in challenging things. So remember for so many years we heard, okay, like nuns don't get dementia, and then there's all sorts of things you can imagine could be related to that. And then we're thinking, oh, maybe it's crossword puzzles. Maybe it's crossword puzzles. Maybe it's hanging out with other people. And then you know that person down the street and she's cycling on the weekends like crazy and she's 90 and she looks like she's 50 and she's sharp as a tack. It's probably leaning into challenge on a regular basis. Leaning into challenge on a regular basis as opposed to one specific cognitive or physical thing, which means that if you love cycling or you love the cold plunge or you love a certain form of exercise, it's probably not doing that much for your anterior mid-singulate cortex. But these super-agers also live longer.\n------------------------\n"

And we can call on the earlier example of eating disorders as a very salient one, right? There is a way in which all of this can run amok and we can get so heavily into stoicism, we can get so heavily into the idea of building up tenacity and willpower that it takes us into realms that are unhealthy for us psychologically, emotionally, and or physically. And that's certainly not the goal here. And I certainly don't want to motivate that type of behavior or resistance of behavior. We should all be seeking a relationship with life and with goals, et cetera, that involves, yes, I believe some degree of activating tenacity and willpower, really finding that fight within us that Parvizzi and colleagues found when they stimulated the anterior mid-singulate cortex of people, right?

This is super important if you're thinking about tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower. If for instance, you love cold showers and ice baths, well, then it's very unlikely that taking cold showers or getting into an ice bath is going to increase your level of tenacity and willpower further. It might reinforce the tenacity and willpower that you've already built, but it's not going to increase it further. You need to add something or subtract something that makes it harder, not easier to engage in or resist a behavior. Okay, I want to be really clear about this.\n------------------------\n"

And it also speaks to the power of the specificity. It's not like he thought that his foot was on fire. He thought because he saw a nail going through his foot, it was going through his boot, but he thought it was going through his foot, that it was sharp pain of the sort that a nail would produce. And there are thousands of these kinds of case reports out there. Now that is not to say that all pain that we experience is in our head, but it really speaks to the incredible capacity that these top-down, these higher level cognitive functions have in interpreting what we're experiencing out in the periphery, even just on the basis of what we see. And the example of radiation speaks to the fact that pain and tissue damage are dissociable from one another, okay? So why are we talking about pain during a month on neuroplasticity?\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode 32 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the neurobiology of pain and pleasure, focusing on how they are processed by the brain and how our perception can be influenced by various factors. He explains that skin is our largest sensory organ, housing nerve cells that detect stimuli like touch, temperature, and pressure, which can lead to experiences of pain or pleasure. Huberman delves into the role of dopamine, not as a pleasure molecule, but as a modulator of motivation and anticipation, highlighting the concept of reward prediction error and its impact on motivation.\n\nHe further details the importance of intermittent reward schedules for sustained motivation and how understanding these mechanisms can enhance our ability to experience pleasure and reduce pain. Huberman also touches upon the subjective nature of pain, influenced by factors such as expectation, anxiety, sleep, circadian rhythms, and genetics. He discusses the somatosensory cortex, which contains a body map that interprets sensory signals, and the phenomenon of referred sensations and\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And he looked down and he saw the nail going through his boot and he was in absolute excruciating pain. They took him to the hospital and because the nail was so long and because of where it had entered and exited the boot, they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail. And when they did that, they revealed that the nail had passed between two of his toes. It had actually failed to impale his body in any way. And yet the view, the perception of that nail entering his boot at one end and exiting the boot at the other was sufficient to create the experience of a nail that had gone through his foot. And the moment he realized that that nail had not gone through his foot, the pain completely evaporated. And this has been demonstrated numerous times. People that work in emergency rooms actually see variations on this, not always that extreme, but many times what we see and how we perceive that wound or that event has a profound influence on how we experience pain.\n------------------------\n",

And it's all going to be through that top-down modulation that we talked about, not unlike the mirror box experiments with phantom limb that relieve phantom pain or some other top-down modulation in the opposite examples, the nail through the boot, which is a visual image that made the person think it was painful when in fact it was painful, even though there was no tissue damage, it was all perceptual. So the pain system is really subject to these perceptual influences, which is remarkable because really when we think about the somatosensory system, it has this cognitive component, it's got this peripheral component, but there's another component, which is the way in which our sensation, our somatosensory system is woven in with our autonomic nervous system. And we're going to get to that next, but I want to just raise the idea that the reason that this kind of infatuation and obsessive love can blunt the pain response and increase one's threshold for pain may have to do, I would say almost certainly has to do, but it hasn't been measured yet, with dopamine release.\n------------------------\n"

He explains common pathways underlying various mood disorders and how treatments for one can inform treatments for others. Huberman also delves into the pleasure-pain balance and the role of dopamine in motivation, drive, and addiction. The episode covers how pursuit of pleasure can lead to a pain response and how constant pursuit can reduce dopamine release and increase craving, potentially leading to addiction. He provides a real-life example of a young man experiencing depression due to disruption in the pleasure-pain balance. Huberman emphasizes the importance of entering states of non-pleasure to reset this balance and cautions against pursuits that cause excessive dopamine release. He also distinguishes between major depression and bipolar depression, noting the episode's focus on the former. He outlines the symptoms and biological mechanisms of major depression, noting its high prevalence and impact on disability.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: The numbers vary from study to study, but basically the more closely related you are to somebody who has major depression, the more likely it is that you will also get major depression. And therefore, if you haven't gotten major depression, the more likely it is that you should take steps to learn to mitigate stress because stress is the major factor that can trigger one of these depressive episodes. Okay, so we've covered a lot related to the stress and the hormones and the neurochemistry of depression. In fact, I think this is probably the deepest I've ever gone into the biology of any topic on this podcast before getting to any specific tools.

He highlights the effectiveness of various methods, including behavioral, nutritional, supplement-based, brain machine interface-based, and prescription drug tools. The episode emphasizes zero-cost strategies which tap into neurochemistry and neural circuits to enhance cognitive abilities. Dr. Suzuki's research on a 13-minute daily meditation protocol is mentioned, which significantly boosts focus and concentration abilities within eight weeks. Additionally, Huberman warns against engaging in focused-based meditation within four hours of bedtime, as it may disrupt sleep. The podcast also explores the roles of epinephrine, acetylcholine, and dopamine in focus and concentration, using an arrow metaphor to illustrate their interactions. Finally, Huberman discusses the importance of sleep, sound-based tools like 40Hz binaural beats, white noise, and the benefits of stress, including acute cold exposure, in enhancing cognitive performance.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: If you want to think about tools of any kind to modify your biology or physiology in any way, whether or not it's for cognitive function or you want to get better at exercising or you want to build muscle or you want to improve your hormones, you need to think and understand tools in the context of modulation and mediation. What do I mean by that? Well, it's quite simple, really. Mediation is how specific types of chemicals and cells and circuits and organs control very specific things in your brain and body. Whereas modulation is the ability of chemicals and cells and circuits to adjust how different things change, how different things work in your brain and body, but to do it more broadly. What do I mean by this? Let me give an example. For instance, I'm going to tell you now that one of the most important things to build and maintain your focus and concentration is to optimize your sleeping behavior. That is to get enough quality sleep, I would say 80% of the nights of your life. Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100% of the nights of their life. Nobody, truly nobody achieves that.\n------------------------\n",

He explains that these hormones are essential throughout life for the development and maintenance of the body and brain. Huberman emphasizes that thyroid hormone, which needs iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine to be produced, is crucial for converting energy from fats and sugars, and for promoting growth and repair in various tissues. He also discusses how growth hormone, which can be increased through proper sleep and exercise, is vital for tissue repair and maintaining a healthy body composition. Huberman provides actionable tools for modulating these hormones, including dietary adjustments and specific types of exercise. He also addresses the importance of maintaining proper levels of these hormones for cognitive function and overall health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: That's basically what they're asking in short form. So keeping your thyroid hormone healthy, at healthy levels that is, is going to be terrific for your brain because 75% of your metabolism is from your brain. The ability of your brain to use glucose or ketones for that matter is going to be aided by having healthy thyroid. So do the things, take the things, eat the things that are going to allow you to have healthy levels of thyroid hormone. I'm sure a number of you are out there wondering, do I have healthy levels of thyroid hormone? Those can be measured from the blood. There's some telltale signs of having really high thyroid or really low thyroid. And I could start listing those off. They're easy to find online as well. Things like, you know, bulging eyes, inability to maintain weight, shaky, anxiety, that's kind of hyperthyroidal, thinning of hair, this kind of thing. I don't want to get into diagnosing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

In its simplest form, your nervous system is made of nerve cells that we call neurons. Neurons communicate with one another through chemicals. They release certain chemicals that make other neurons more or less likely to be electrically active. What do we mean by electrically active? We mean, as it sounds, electricity passing down through cells and then literally causing electricity in other cells. The simplest way to think about this is maybe when you were a kid or maybe even still now, you would wear socks and you'd shuffle along the floor to generate some static electricity and then you'd touch someone and you'd shock them with your finger. I'm a younger brother, so I'd occasionally do that to my sister. I had friends, we would do that to one another. I know it's kind of silly and childish, yet it illustrates the principle that we can generate electricity and pass electricity to other beings, or in the case of neurons, from one neuron to the next. The way neurons do that is that in between the neurons, there are little spaces.\n------------------------\n",

And neurons literally vomit. Well, they don't literally vomit, but they release little packets of so-called transmitter chemical into that space we call a synapse. It travels across the synapse. It attaches to the cell on the other side, the other neuron. And then depending on what that chemical is, it either makes that next neuron more electrically active or less electrically active, so-called excitation. It either excites the next neuron to be electrically active also, or it inhibits, it prevents the next neuron from being electrically active. So again, very simply, we have nerve cells that communicate with one another through electricity and chemicals that inspire that electricity. And the little gaps between neurons are called synapses.

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast #98, Andrew Huberman discusses the complex nature of happiness, highlighting the scientific efforts to understand and define it. He explains that happiness is a sought-after state that most people cannot precisely define, yet recognize when experienced. Huberman introduces the concept of operational definitions, which are agreed-upon terms for abstract concepts like happiness, and acknowledges the difficulty in scientifically pinning down such a subjective emotion.\n\nThe episode focuses on three main topics: defining happiness as a brain state and a state of mind and body, tools and practices for achieving states of happiness, and misconceptions and contradictions in happiness research. Huberman challenges the common belief that happiness only comes from external achievements, introducing the idea of synthesized happiness, which involves concrete steps and is potentially more powerful than externally driven happiness. He also discusses the contradictions between common advice for achieving happiness and the realities of life's pressures, such as the balance between work, social connections, and self-care.\n\nHuberman aims to provide a framework\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, equally important is to understand that while we do have neurotransmitters, that is the chemicals that are released between neurons, nerve cells that allow neurons to communicate, things like glutamate and GABA, for instance, and we have what are called neuromodulators. These are chemicals also released by neurons that impact the electrical firing and chemical release of other neurons, things like serotonin and dopamine and acetylcholine and epinephrine. Neuromodulators and neurotransmitters are always present in a cocktail in our brain and body. That is, they are present in different ratios and at different levels. So we need to completely discard with the idea that any one neurotransmitter or any one neuromodulator is solely responsible for a state of happiness or for a lack of state of happiness for that matter. That said, it is true that for people that tend to have lower baseline levels of, for instance, dopamine, their levels of happiness, or we should say their self-reported levels of happiness, tend to be lower than for those that have greatly elevated baseline levels of dopamine.\n------------------------\n"

In its simplest form, your nervous system is made of nerve cells that we call neurons. Neurons communicate with one another through chemicals. They release certain chemicals that make other neurons more or less likely to be electrically active. What do we mean by electrically active? We mean, as it sounds, electricity passing down through cells and then literally causing electricity in other cells. The simplest way to think about this is maybe when you were a kid or maybe even still now, you would wear socks and you'd shuffle along the floor to generate some static electricity and then you'd touch someone and you'd shock them with your finger. I'm a younger brother, so I'd occasionally do that to my sister. I had friends, we would do that to one another. I know it's kind of silly and childish, yet it illustrates the principle that we can generate electricity and pass electricity to other beings, or in the case of neurons, from one neuron to the next. The way neurons do that is that in between the neurons, there are little spaces.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How Your Nervous System Works & Changes\" with host Andrew Huberman delves into the intricacies of the nervous system, which is crucial for every aspect of human experience. Huberman outlines the nervous system's components, including the brain, spinal cord, and the connections between them and the body's organs. He explains the continuous communication loop that constitutes our nervous system, likening it to a Mobius strip, emphasizing its role in governing all other biological systems. The podcast also explores the historical discoveries of neurons and synapses, the impact of warfare on neuroscience, and the concept of neuroplasticity, which allows the nervous system to change in response to experience. Huberman discusses the importance of sleep and deep rest in consolidating learning and facilitating neuroplasticity. He introduces the concept of ultradian rhythms, 90-minute cycles governing our ability to focus and rest, and the autonomic nervous system's role in managing the transition between wakefulness\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: There's nothing mystical about this. You're a flow of electricity between these different nerve cells. And depending on which nerve cells are active, you might be lifting your arm or lowering your arm. You might be seeing something and perceiving that it's red, or you might be seeing something and perceiving that it's green, all depending on which nerve cells are electrically active at a given moment. The example of perceiving red or perceiving green is a particularly good example because so often our experience of the world makes it seem as if these things that are happening outside us are actually happening inside us. But the language of the nervous system is just electricity. It's just like a Morse code of some sort, or the syllables and words and consonants and vowels of language. It just depends on how they're assembled, what order. And so that brings us to the issue of how the nervous system works. The way to think about how the nervous system works is that our experiences, our memories, everything is sort of like the keys on a piano being played in a particular order, right?\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Control Pain & Heal Faster with Your Brain\" episode, Andrew Huberman discusses the neurobiology of pain, healing, and neuroplasticity. He explains that our nervous system possesses a unique feature called neuroplasticity, which allows it to change in response to experiences and deliberate actions. The episode delves into the concept of unlearning or removing unwanted experiences, particularly focusing on pain, regeneration, and injury to the nervous system. Huberman emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between injury and pain, and the subjective nature of pain which can be influenced by our mental state and beliefs. He also discusses the role of the somatosensory system in processing various types of physical stimuli and the controversial term \"nociception\" in the neuroscience field. Huberman highlights how love and infatuation can modulate pain perception and the impact of certain types of exercises, like zone two cardio, on brain health and the glymphatic system. The episode also touches on the mechanisms behind\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And I'm very excited to share with you this information because I do feel that it can be of great benefit to a number of people. So let's start our discussion about pain and sensation and regeneration and wound healing with a discussion about a very important system in the nervous system, which is the somatosensory system. The somatosensory system is, as the name implies, involved in understanding touch, physical feeling on our body. And the simplest way to think about the somatosensory system is that we have little sensors, and those sensors come in the form of neurons, nerve cells, that reside in our skin and in the deeper layers below the skin. And indeed we do. We have some that correspond to, and we should say respond to mechanical touch. So, you know, pressure on the top of my hand or a pinpoint or other sensors, for instance, respond to heat, to cold, some respond to vibration. We have a huge number of different receptors in our skin And they take that information and send it down these wires that we call axons in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord and then up to the brain.\n------------------------\n"

There's a little bit of linguistic jargon, but I'm going to make a point here with that is that certain classes of sounds, when you make them, it requires you to actually close your mouth temporarily. Now I'm going to be thinking about this. So plosive, like saying the word plosive requires that. Exactly. So what's cool about that is that we actually have no idea what's going on in our mouth when we speak we really have no idea some people definitely have no idea well not just like in terms of what you're saying sometimes but actually like how you're actually moving right you know the different parts of vocal track and I have a feeling if we actually required understanding we would never be able to speak because it's so complex. It's such a complex feat. Some people would say it's the most complex motor thing that we do as a species is speaking, not the extreme feats of acrobatics or athleticism, but speaking. Especially when one observes opera or people who freestyle rappers. And of course, it's not just the lips. It's the tongue.\n------------------------\n",

Those are a certain class of consonants that we call plosive sounds. There's another class of sounds that we call fricatives in linguistics. Fricatives are created by turbulence in the airstream as it comes out through the mouth. And the way that we make that turbulence is getting the mouth and the lips to close almost until they're completely shut. Or putting the tongue near the teeth to almost get it completely shut, but just have a narrow aperture. That creates a turbulence in the airflow that we perceive as a high frequency sound. So those are the sounds like sha and tha, those kind of things. Those are, if you look at the frequencies, they're higher frequencies and those are created by specific movements that you constrict the airflow to create turbulence. And we hear it as sha, sa, tha. So if I say that. Exactly. And as opposed to a plosive where I'd say explosive. Right. Now, of course, I'm emphasizing here.\n------------------------\n",

The areas that are really important for speech are on the side of that. And we now think that speech can go straight to the speech cortex without having to go through the primary auditory cortex, that it has its own pathway to get to the part of the brain that processes speech. And when we've looked at that question about is there a map, the short answer is yes, there is a map. But it is not structured universally across all people in a way that we can clearly see right now. It is like a salt and pepper map of the different features in speech. So before we talked about these sounds that are called plosives, you make a plosive when the mouth or something in the oral cavity closes temporarily. And when it opens, that creates that fast plosive sound. So when you say dad or the ball, like the B in ball, that kind of thing, you will notice that your lips actually close and then it's the release of that that creates that particular sounds. So those are the sounds that we call plosive.\n------------------------\n"

Because, you know, if today, for example, I felt unwell and I trace back what happened yesterday and it turns out, hey, I ate this burrito that was out in the sun for way too long, the question is, am I feeling sick because of the burrito or did the burrito just happen to be something that happened but it's independent of how I'm feeling? Maybe it turns out somebody was actually sick with a GI bug around me, and that's the reason that I'm feeling the way I am today. So the analysis that needs to be done on cases that are reported is important, and it's something that the CDC and the FDA do together. Now, that analysis, I think, is essential to communicate clearly to the public. And whenever I engage with folks in the public, which we do often, and people will talk to me about their experiences with vaccines, I do think it's important to acknowledge what people have gone through.\n------------------------\n",

So I think that's what we've got to do here too. One last thing I'll say is that it's important I think also for us to help put this in context of other vaccines and medicines and interventions that we use. So for example, just take Tylenol, for example. Like most people think, oh, well, Tylenol, it's safe. There's nothing bad happens if you take Tylenol, et cetera. But people who track the data know that Tylenol by and large is generally speaking speaking, a safe medication. But there are people who experience adverse effects from Tylenol, liver damage, you know, and other adverse effects. And, you know, that data is available. But what has happened in the case of that medication is that the risks and benefits are both analyzed and then a recommendation is put forward about a generally safe way to use it.\n------------------------\n",

Now melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement, but melatonin is naturally released as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours, it's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy and allows you to fall asleep. So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep.

            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Using Science to Optimize Sleep, Learning & Metabolism\" episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the interplay between light exposure, exercise, temperature, and supplementation and their effects on sleep, learning, and metabolism. He emphasizes the importance of getting adequate light early in the day to set circadian rhythms and support alertness, and avoiding bright light at night to prevent disrupting sleep and mood. Huberman also explores how temperature fluctuations can influence our body's rhythms and the timing of exercise for optimal performance. Additionally, he touches on the use of certain supplements to potentially enhance sleep quality, though individual responses can vary. Throughout, Huberman underscores the need for personalized approaches to health and well-being, integrating science-based insights with individual needs and responses.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And that's because it adjusts your retinal sensitivity and your melatonin pathway so that light is not as detrimental to melatonin at night. Think about the afternoon sunlight viewing as kind of a, I think of it as kind of a Netflix inoculation. It allows me to watch a little bit of Netflix in the evening, although it's very hard to watch a little bit of anything on Netflix. It seems like there's some other neurobiological process going on there where I have to watch episode after episode after episode. But in any case, you can protect yourself against some of that bad effect of light at night by looking at light in the evening. It really does adjust down the sensitivity of the system. Okay, I want to talk about seasonal changes in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism. So depending on where you are in the world, Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere, at the equator or closer to the poles, the days and nights are going to be different lengths. That just makes sense. But that translates to real biological signals that impact everything from wakefulness and sleep times, but also mood and metabolism. So here's how this works.\n------------------------\n",

He explains that grief is a complex emotion, involving more than just sadness, but also a yearning for the lost person or pet. The episode delves into the neuroscience and psychology behind grief, revealing that we map our experiences of people in three dimensions: space, time, and closeness. These dimensions are what establish bonds and require reorganization within our emotional and logical framework when we lose someone. Huberman discusses the concept of neuroplasticity, which is the reordering of brain connections necessary to move through grief. He debunks the myth of universal stages of grief, emphasizing that people experience and process grief differently. The podcast also touches on the impact of one's psychological and biological state at the time of loss on the grieving process. Huberman provides scientific information and tools to help navigate grief, including the importance of understanding grief as a motivational state. He distingu\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Well, having an early day cortisol peak and a very low cortisol level late in the day, 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. is immensely beneficial. It reflects a properly regulated autonomic nervous system. It means being alert during the day and your ability to sleep at night is tightly correlated to this viewing of sunlight in the morning. If you have additional questions about this or these protocols, please see our Mastering Sleep episode also at hubermanlab.com. But in brief, you don't want to wear sunglasses when you do this. You do not want to do this through a window or a windshield. It is 50 times less effective at least because of filtering of the proper wavelengths. It is fine to wear eyeglasses, meaning corrective lenses or contacts, even if they have UV protection. Again, sunlight is best, 10 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on how bright it is outside and so on and so forth. I keep coming back to this protocol because first of all, it is a zero cost, but very effective way to regulate things like cortisol rhythms, melatonin rhythms, wakefulness during the day, ease of falling asleep at night and so on.\n------------------------\n"

It's worth trying to deal with the problem you're dealing with. So you can get better at using it at the level that you have. There was a study done in which they tried to train people to be more hypnotizable. And, you know, obviously there are subjective and behavioral components to the test.

He answers common questions from listeners, structuring the discussion around a typical day to illustrate how to apply these protocols. Huberman explains that our body and brain functions are deeply tied to the 24-hour circadian rhythm, which is influenced by our environment and genes. He shares his personal daily routine as an example, emphasizing that it's not prescriptive but demonstrates how to leverage science to enhance various aspects of life within the framework of a day. Key points include the importance of morning sunlight exposure, the benefits of forward ambulation and optic flow, hydration, strategic caffeine consumption, fasting for mental clarity, exercise regimens, and nutrient timing to support brain and overall health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: What this paper essentially shows is that specific areas of our brain that are involved in executive function, which is associated with our ability to focus, as well as what's called the default mode network, which is sort of the way that your brain idles. Does your brain tend to idle at a level of high anxiety or calm, as well as activation of a brain area called the insula. That's I-N-S-U-L-A. The insula is extremely interesting. Hypnosis has been shown to activate the insula, which can enhance our sense of interoception, our sense of internal state, which might sound like a annoying thing. You don't want to be thinking about your heartbeat or your breathing. But what's really interesting about hypnosis is that it increases areas of the brain that are responsible for deep relaxation, focus, and self-awareness, this interoception simultaneously.

If you're interested in the biochemistry, you can look that up. It's acetylated into a form that can cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier, or BB BBB is a barrier, it's a wall around the brain. And you have this barrier because the brain is so important and it has this feature that the neurons there don't recreate themselves after injury, like other organs of the body. There's not a lot of turnover of cells, despite what you might've heard. And so nature has created this BBB, this blood brain barrier to make sure that certain molecules, in particular large molecules, don't get across the blood-brain barrier because it can be damaging to those tissues. Incidentally, you also have a very rigid or stringent barrier around other organs, which are the gonads.\n------------------------\n",

            "\nShow Summary: In episode #90 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the effects of nicotine on the brain and body, its addictive nature due to its impact on brain chemicals, and strategies for quitting smoking or vaping. Nicotine, commonly consumed through smoking, has both detrimental health effects and, in specific non-smoking modalities, potential benefits for cognitive function. Huberman explains how nicotine increases dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which can enhance focus, alertness, and mood. However, smoking and vaping, particularly among young people, are on the rise and carry significant health risks due to the damage they cause to the body's endothelial cells and the presence of carcinogens. The episode also covers the challenges of quitting smoking due to nicotine's reinforcement through the dopamine system and offers insights into using nicotine replacement therapies effectively.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, as I mentioned before, nicotine gets into the bloodstream and then because nicotine can pass through the so-called blood brain barrier, the BBB, which is basically a fence around the brain, because it can pass through the blood brain barrier, it's going to have very rapid effects on the brain in these four major categories of neurochemicals and neural circuits. The first of those categories, and this is a very important one, this is one that was brought up in the episode on dopamine motivation and drive. And I think not just all scientists, but all human beings should know that within their brain, they have what is called the mesolimbic reward pathway. The mesolimbic reward pathway, if you just want to call it the dopamine reward pathway, is, as the name suggests, a set of connections between a brain area called the ventral tegmental area. You don't have to remember the names of these things, of course, but if you want to, that's fine too. The ventral tegmental area, or VTA, connects to another area called the nucleus accumbens.

The melanocortin system is a system whereby viewing light or getting light on the skin, typically ultraviolet light of the ultraviolet B type. Okay, there's two different types of ultraviolet light, but basically sunlight is what the system evolved to respond to, shown to the eyes and or to the skin, stimulates the melanocortin system.

Now, for any of you that have lived in a part of the world in which it's very, very dark with very short days in the winter and longer days and a lot of sunlight during the summer, you're probably familiar with the fact that when the sun comes out, people start feeling better. They have more energy, they're more motivated. A number of different systems related to mood and libido tend to increase. This is the consequence of sunlight activating the melanocorticoid system. And by the way, this system is very active in other animals as well, animals that are white or tend to be of pale color during the winter. Then as spring arrives, the sunlight stimulates this very same system and leads to darkening of the pelage. So their hair goes from white or gray to brown or even dark black or some combination of those. And in combination, dopamine is increased, libido is increased, and the animals start breeding in the spring and summer months.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 68, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the myriad ways light, particularly different wavelengths such as sunlight, blue light, and red light, can significantly impact our health. He delves into the benefits of light for skin health, hormone balance, sleep regulation, mood enhancement, and even dementia prevention. Huberman explains that light affects our biology by converting into electrical and hormone signals, triggering cascades of biological pathways, and altering gene expression. He highlights the historical and scientific basis for phototherapy, emphasizing its effectiveness when grounded in quality science. The episode also explores the pioneering work of Dr. Glenn Jeffery on red light therapy for age-related vision loss, demonstrating how brief red light exposure can rejuvenate retinal cells by enhancing their energy production. Huberman promises to provide specific protocols based on peer-reviewed literature for using light to modulate health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And it turns out that people who have darker skin actually need more vitamin D3 and or more sunlight exposure in order to activate that D3 pathway than do people with paler skin. And this should make sense to all of you, given what you now understand about melanocytes, that cell type that we discussed earlier, because melanocytes have pigment within them. And if you have darker skin, it means that you have more melanocytes or that you have melanocytes that are more efficient at creating pigment. And as a consequence, the light that lands on your skin will be absorbed by those melanocytes and less of it is able to impact the D3 pathway. Whereas if you have pale skin, more of the light that lands on your skin can trigger the synthesis and assist the actions of vitamin D3. Similarly, in this study, they found that people who had paler skin and or who originated from countries where they had less UVB light exposure across the year had greater, meaning more significant increases in testosterone overall than did people who already were getting a lot of UVB exposure. This led them to explore so-called seasonal changes in testosterone that occurred normally in the absence of any light exposure treatment.\n------------------------\n"

So let's back up a little bit and talk about the melanocortin system, right? The melanocortin system is a system whereby viewing light or getting light on the skin, typically ultraviolet light of the ultraviolet B type. Okay, there's two different types of ultraviolet light, but basically sunlight is what the system evolved to respond to, shown to the eyes and or to the skin, stimulates the melanocortin system. It goes from the eyes to the hypothalamus, from the hypothalamus to the pituitary, and then the melanocyte-stimulating hormone is then released into the bloodstream, can travel to the melanocytes and cause pigmentation of the skin. This is what is responsible for tanning.\n------------------------\n",

So there are essentially five different synthetic peptides called melanotan 1, 2, 3, 4, and five, each of which is designed to mimic melanocyte-simulating hormone, but each of which activates different receptors to different degrees, and some can cross the blood-brain barrier and some can't, and as a consequence, some impact mood and libido and others don't. The simple way to look at this is that melanotan one does not cross the blood brain barrier. It does however stimulate the melanocytes of the skin. So it leads to tanning or darkening of the skin. Melanotan two, three, four, and five also lead to darkening of the skin by way of activating melanocytes in the skin. But because they can cross the blood brain barrier, they cause effects that are at the level of psychology really, and at the level of appetite and things of that sort. In general, the pattern is to increase mood and libido and to decrease appetite.\n------------------------\n",

Also, folks with melanoma should be very cautious about using any of the peptides that stimulate melanocytes because that could potentially exacerbate melanoma. The next peptide in this category of peptides for vitality and libido is kispeptin. Kispeptin is a peptide that wasn't discovered that long ago. Actually, you can recall when the first papers about kispeptin came out. And basically, kispeptin is a peptide that is naturally made within the brain, and it's upstream of some of the hypothalamic signals that activate the pituitary for sake of hormone production and reproduction. So I'll just walk you through this pathway. It's actually quite simple. You've got the pituitary, you're now familiar with the pituitary, and the pituitary releases two different hormones in both males and females. It releases luteinizing hormone, and it releases follicle stimulating hormone.\n------------------------\n"

Contrast that with people who have bipolar II disorder who are spending about half of their time in a depressed state. So that's interesting. People with bipolar II disorder, while not always displaying depressed states or oscillations between mania or hypomania and depressed states, they tend to be in a depressed state more often. And again, this is major depression. This isn't just a little bit of a low, this is a serious depression of their nervous system, their mood, and as we say, their affect, their outlook on life. And that's one of the key distinguishing features of major depression is that people's outlook on life becomes very diminished in the sense that they don't see a future. You ask them about, you know, how's work going? How are relationships? And it's not just that they feel that that's going poorly. They really feel as if there's no opportunity for those things to improve.\n------------------------\n",

There are a couple other key features about bipolar 1 and bipolar 2 that can allow us to get better insight into whether or not somebody has bipolar 1 or bipolar 2. And that's the percentage of time that people with bipolar 1 versus bipolar 2 spend in a manic state, a depressed state, or a symptom-free state. And this is also important to discuss because it turns out that people with genuine diagnosed bipolar one or bipolar two are often symptom-free, which again can make it difficult for us as people that know them or for people that are treating people with bipolar disorder to identify whether or not somebody is in a manic episode or a depressive episode or whether or not they are headed into a manic or depressive episode.

I think it's fair to say that if somebody is suffering from bipolar one, that is likely to be revealed or to reveal itself before too long because of the fact that people have these extended periods of mania and mania is such an extreme state, not just for the person who's experiencing it, but the way that it presents is just so extreme and out of the ordinary. But bipolar II, you can imagine, could really duck under the radar of our awareness. And you could imagine that we might just think somebody is low or depressed, especially if that person tends to self-medicate with alcohol or other substances. We might think, oh, well, they're drinking more than usual, excuse me, or they're spending more time alone and isolating.\n------------------------\n"

It has nothing to do with emotional sympathy. It has to do with a bunch of neurons in the middle of your spinal cord called the sympathetic chain ganglia and some other related neural networks in your body, as well as regions of your brain, like the locus coeruleus that release things like epinephrine and norepinephrine and make you more alert. And in a kind of magnificent arrangement, or I think magnificent arrangement, when we have fluid in our gut and when our cells are well hydrated, and believe it or not, when our bladder contains fluid within it, there is an elevation in activity of the sympathetic nervous system by way of two pathways.

Huberman discusses various forms of aggression, such as reactive, proactive, and indirect aggression, and the distinct biological mechanisms that underpin them. He explains the neural circuits, hormones, peptides, and neurotransmitters involved in aggression and offers accessible explanations for listeners regardless of their science background. The episode also covers psychological and biological tools for controlling aggression, the context in which aggression occurs, and the pleasure humans can derive from it, including vicarious aggression through sports. Huberman touches on the role of aggression in military warfare and the economic investments in it. Additionally, he explores pathological aggression, including explosive aggressive disorder, the relationship between ADHD and impulsivity, and the nuances of verbal and physical aggression. The podcast aims to provide a deeper understanding of aggression, its origins, and how to manage it adaptively.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: On the opposite end of things, alcohol tends to decrease activity in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, tends to make us feel less alert. Now, initially it can create a state of alertness because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain. Our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular has what's called top-down inhibition. It exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus, such as the ventromedial hypothalamus. The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain is able to rationalize and think clearly and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathway. It's telling you, don't say that mean thing, don't do that violent thing, et cetera. Alcohol initially tends to increase our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition, not just in that forebrain circuit, but in other circuits tends to make us more active.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode 49 of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the modern neuroscience of fear, trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). He explains that recent neuroscience has illuminated the neural circuits controlling fear responses and how they can be extinguished using behavioral therapies, drug therapies, and brain-machine interfaces. The episode delves into the biology of fear and trauma, the process by which fears are unlearned, and the counterintuitive ways stress can be used to combat fear. Huberman emphasizes that fears cannot simply be eliminated; they must be replaced with new positive events using specific tools. He also discusses a study showing that deliberate exposure to stress can alleviate depressive and fear-related symptoms. The podcast provides a framework for understanding the cells, circuits, chemicals, and connections in the body that contribute to fear and trauma, as well as practical tools for confronting them.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: It has everything to do with increasing alertness. Think of the sympathetic nervous system as the alertness nervous system. It's what ramps up your levels of alertness, ramps up your levels of vigilance. Think about it as the accelerator on your alertness and attention. The other branch of the autonomic nervous system is the so-called parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. I know that's a mouthful. The parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system are the cells and neurons and chemicals and other aspects of your brain and body that are involved in the calming nervous system. So sympathetic is alerting, parasympathetic is calming, and it acts as sort of a seesaw to adjust your overall level of alertness. So for instance, right now I'm alert, but I feel pretty calm. I'm not ready to go to sleep or anything like that. I don't feel like I need a nap. I'm alert, but I'm calm. I'm not in a state of stress or panic. So that seesaw we could imagine is more or less level.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 68, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the myriad ways light, particularly different wavelengths such as sunlight, blue light, and red light, can significantly impact our health. He delves into the benefits of light for skin health, hormone balance, sleep regulation, mood enhancement, and even dementia prevention. Huberman explains that light affects our biology by converting into electrical and hormone signals, triggering cascades of biological pathways, and altering gene expression. He highlights the historical and scientific basis for phototherapy, emphasizing its effectiveness when grounded in quality science. The episode also explores the pioneering work of Dr. Glenn Jeffery on red light therapy for age-related vision loss, demonstrating how brief red light exposure can rejuvenate retinal cells by enhancing their energy production. Huberman promises to provide specific protocols based on peer-reviewed literature for using light to modulate health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, it's not the case that you can simply think, okay, spleen, turn on, release killer cells, go out and combat infection. However, UVB light arriving on the eyes is known to trigger activation of the neurons within the so-called sympathetic nervous system. These neurons are part of the larger thing that we call the autonomic nervous system, meaning it's below or not accessible by conscious control. It's the thing that controls your heartbeat, controls your breathing, and that also activates or flips on the switch of your immune system. When we get a lot of UVB light in our eyes, or I should say sufficient UVB light in our eyes, a particular channel, a particular set of connections within the sympathetic nervous system is activated and our spleen deploys immune cells and molecules that scavenge for and combat infection. So if you've noticed that you get fewer colds and flus and other forms of illness in the summer months, part of that could be because of the increase in temperature in your environment, because typically longer days are associated with more warmth in your environment, as opposed to winter days, which are short and tend to be colder out.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast #44, Andrew Huberman discusses the intricate relationship between the nervous system and the immune system, highlighting recent scientific discoveries that reveal how the mind and nervous system can influence immune response. He references a study published in Nature demonstrating that acupuncture can reduce inflammation by stimulating certain body sites, releasing cells and molecules that enhance immune function. Huberman explains that the nervous system acts as a network, activating the immune system and reducing inflammation, which leads to faster healing. He also discusses non-acupuncture methods for boosting immune function, emphasizing the importance of a healthy nervous system in overall immune health. The episode aims to demystify the concept of healing with the mind by grounding it in scientific research, and Huberman separates his podcast from his academic roles, stressing his commitment to sharing science-based tools with the public.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Well, to make a long story short-ish, because I am going to go into depth here, the reason it works is because the sympathetic nervous system, the so-called stress part of our nervous system, it's not really called that, but the part of our nervous system that triggers stress from mild stress to severe stress, even to panic, causes the release of adrenaline and epinephrine in the brain and body. And under normal circumstances, when we have some sort of invading infection, our body is able to push back on that to resist it by engaging the stress response. So what's happening here is there's a behavioral protocol involving the nervous system, because all behaviors are generated from the nervous system, of course, a behavioral protocol that people are deliberately employing that allows them to activate the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn allows them to activate the normal pathways by which immune system function is enhanced, okay? Now, the reason I'm underscoring this is that the common interpretation of this study is that somehow it blocks the normal immune response, but that's not really what's happening here.\n------------------------\n"

You know, one of the first things that happens when the baby comes out is they look at the genitalia and they try and make an assessment on whether or not it's a quote boy or it's a quote girl, right? That's been done for a very, very long time throughout human history. It turns out that it's not testosterone that's responsible for the development of the penis in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome. It's a different androgen. Androgen is just a category of hormones that includes testosterone, but testosterone is converted in the fetus to something called dihydrotestosterone. And that's accomplished through an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. Now, dihydrotestosterone has important effects later in life too. We will talk about those. In fact, if you just want to know, dihydrotestosterone is what we would call the dominant androgen in males. It's responsible for aggression.\n------------------------\n",

For males, he discusses spermatogenesis and the journey sperm take to reach and fertilize the egg.

But just to give you a sense of how X chromosomes and Y chromosomes can actually accomplish that sexual differentiation, both of body and brain. I'll just mention in two sentences that for instance, if there's a Y chromosome, as opposed to an X chromosome, that Y chromosome contains genes that suppress, for instance, the development of female genitalia and thereby give rise to male genitalia. So rather than the formation of a clitoris is the formation of a penis and rather than the formation of ovaries, the formation of a testes. Okay. So that's more directed towards sexual differentiation. We're not going to get into that right now. We'll get into that in a future episode. But even if you're only tracking about 10% of what I'm saying right now, I promise you're doing great. If you're tracking more than 10%, well, then you're doing terrifically well, because the essence of fertility and fertilization is to bring together that haploid cell that is the sperm that only has 23 chromosomes, but not pairs of chromosomes, right?\n------------------------\n",

And it turns out that isn't how it works at all. Here's where it's interesting. We have to understand that there are effects of these hormones, testosterone and estrogen, on what are called primary sexual characteristics, which are the ones that you're born with, secondary sexual characteristics, which are the ones that show up in puberty, and these are happening in the brain and body and spinal cord. And so I'm going to disentangle all this for you by giving you some examples. First, let's talk about the development of primary sexual characteristics, the ones that show up at birth. And one of the more dramatic examples of this comes from the role of testosterone in creating the external genitalia. Now you might think it's just straightforward.\n------------------------\n"

You know, one of the first things that happens when the baby comes out is they look at the genitalia and they try and make an assessment on whether or not it's a quote boy or it's a quote girl, right? That's been done for a very, very long time throughout human history. It turns out that it's not testosterone that's responsible for the development of the penis in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome. It's a different androgen. Androgen is just a category of hormones that includes testosterone, but testosterone is converted in the fetus to something called dihydrotestosterone. And that's accomplished through an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. Now, dihydrotestosterone has important effects later in life too. We will talk about those. In fact, if you just want to know, dihydrotestosterone is what we would call the dominant androgen in males. It's responsible for aggression.\n------------------------\n",

It's involved in beard growth and male pattern baldness. We're going to talk about all of that, but dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects in determining the genitalia while the baby is still in the embryo. So there's testosterone that's made and that testosterone gets converted by this enzyme 5-alpha reductase in a little structure called the tubercle. That tubercle will eventually become the penis. So you say, okay, straightforward. This testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone. And then if there's dihydrotestosterone, it controls penis growth. And indeed that's the case. So that's a primary sexual characteristic. That baby will then grow up. And later during puberty, there will be the release of a molecule. I talked about this last episode called kispeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kispeptin, which will cause the release of some other hormones, conantrobin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, will stimulate the testes to make testosterone.\n------------------------\n",

But just to give you a sense of how X chromosomes and Y chromosomes can actually accomplish that sexual differentiation, both of body and brain. I'll just mention in two sentences that for instance, if there's a Y chromosome, as opposed to an X chromosome, that Y chromosome contains genes that suppress, for instance, the development of female genitalia and thereby give rise to male genitalia. So rather than the formation of a clitoris is the formation of a penis and rather than the formation of ovaries, the formation of a testes. Okay. So that's more directed towards sexual differentiation. We're not going to get into that right now. We'll get into that in a future episode. But even if you're only tracking about 10% of what I'm saying right now, I promise you're doing great. If you're tracking more than 10%, well, then you're doing terrifically well, because the essence of fertility and fertilization is to bring together that haploid cell that is the sperm that only has 23 chromosomes, but not pairs of chromosomes, right?\n------------------------\n"

He explains the concept of intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, which involves eating during specific periods of a 24-hour cycle. The episode explores how different schedules of eating can impact health in numerous ways, such as influencing fat loss, muscle dynamics, organ function, and even cognitive and mood states. Huberman emphasizes the importance of the timing of food intake, as it is as crucial as what is eaten. He also introduces tools and strategies to help manage eating schedules without being overly strict, including ways to mitigate the negative effects of occasionally deviating from a set fasting schedule.

That's puberty, but even as adults, for women that are menstruating, there needs to be sufficient leptin signaling to the brain in order to maintain ovulation because of the way that the brain communicates with the pituitary and the ovaries. Similarly, for men, fasting or extreme exercise plus fasting, we now know reduces testosterone. Its impacts are not exactly clear. However, if you reduce food intake, either in total calories or in duration too much, you will suffer a drop in sperm counts. Fertility will drop. And this makes sense. The body is communicating to the brain whether or not conditions are sufficient in the body to reproduce and to presumably and hopefully support the health and wellbeing of those offspring.

Dr. Crawford, an expert in obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive endocrinology, discusses the impact of puberty timing on fertility, the effects of hormonal and non-hormonal birth control on long-term fertility, and the process of measuring fertility, including egg count, egg retrieval, and in vitro fertilization. The conversation also delves into the role of nutrition and supplementation in fertility and hormonal health. Dr. Crawford clarifies misconceptions about fertility treatments such as egg freezing and IVF, emphasizing that they do not deplete a woman's egg reserve. The episode is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of female hormones and fertility for both women and men.\nShow Guest: Dr. Natalie Crawford\nTranscript: Does the body, like I learned some years ago, I think this is still true, that one of the signals for the onset of puberty in females is that leptin hormone is secreted from body fat that then signals to the brain, to the hypothalamus, like, okay, there's enough reserves to create environment. It's a signal about environmental. Yeah, there's enough extra fat to have a baby. Yeah, and there's presumably enough food around to sustain that baby. Right. Are miscarriages and lack of body fat correlated? On both ends of the spectrum, yes. Right. So lack of body fat and being overweight, we see decrease in getting pregnant per month and we see increase in losing pregnancies. So certainly there is a healthy medium where your body has what it needs. And that makes sense because if you have, I like to even say hypothalamic dysfunction. So maybe your brain's not totally shut off where it's sending out no hormones and you're not ovulating because you're not getting pregnant in that circumstance.\n------------------------\n",

So many people believe that one of the reasons that puberty is happening earlier and earlier in females is because of the accumulation of more body fat at younger ages than was observed 30 or 40 and certainly a hundred years ago. Now I can already imagine a number of people are thinking, oh, this must relate to the obesity crisis. And indeed there is a crisis of obesity. Obesity is something that is causing all sorts of problems with people's health at various levels, brain and body. And that is far more frequent today than it was even 20 years ago. So it is indeed a crisis because it has enormous detrimental effects for so many aspects of brain and body health and longevity. But this whole process of thinking about body fat signaling leptin to the hypothalamus and the onset of puberty doesn't necessarily have to do with the obesity crisis.\n------------------------\n"

They showed no statistical interaction, but it seems that if you're going to do these in the same workout episode, that it's move heavy loads first, then do cardiovascular exercise. So there's a little bit of data looking specifically at how endurance exercise impacts testosterone and its derivatives. And it's very clear that high intensity interval training, sprinting, et cetera, which somewhat mimics the neural activity that occurs while moving heavy weight loads is going to increase testosterone. There's ample evidence for that in the literature. And that endurance exercise that extends beyond 75 minutes is going to start to lead to reductions in testosterone, presumably by increases in cortisol. But of course, the intensity of the exercise is going to be important too. I don't think anyone really believes that hiking for the three hours is going to reduce your testosterone. Whereas I think if one were to go out and run hard for three hours, that you can imagine there'd be reductions in testosterone by way of increases in cortisol.\n------------------------\n",

And of course, if menstruation is ceasing, chances are almost with certainty that you're not getting regular ovulations. Now, in terms of males and whether or not intermittent fasting is going to disrupt spermatogenesis and testosterone production, there's essentially no data we can look to, but we can look to the general logic around the relationship between body fat, testosterone, and spermatogenesis.

Many people are aware that their blood sugar, that is their blood glucose level, is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body. Most people do not know, however, how different foods and different activities, including exercise or different temperature environments, impact their blood glucose levels.

He explains that sugar affects our brain and body through two main mechanisms: the rewarding taste of sugar, which triggers a desire for more, and the nutritive content of sugar, which impacts our cravings at a subconscious level. Huberman delves into the body's reaction to ingesting sugar, highlighting that while sugar is a powerful brain fuel, too little or too much can negatively affect neuronal function. He also covers the hormonal responses to eating, like the increase of ghrelin when hungry and its suppression after eating, and the role of insulin in regulating blood glucose levels. The episode also touches on the metabolic demands of the brain, the preference for glucose as a fuel source, and the complex neural circuits that drive us to seek out sugary foods. Huberman suggests that understanding these mechanisms can help us make better-informed choices about our sugar consumption\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, some of those could be due to sleep apnea caused by even just the size of somebody's neck or the weight of their body. In other words, we don't know the direction of the effect, right? Metabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep, which disrupt metabolic syndromes. And indeed the authors point out quite appropriately that they don't understand the direction of the effects that they observe either. But there is now a plethora of data pointing to the fact that getting quality sleep each night helps regulate not only appetite, but also the specific forms of metabolism that drive specific appetites. So the takeaway is while there are extravagant and potent and interesting ways to regulate blood glucose, everything from cinnamon to lemon juice, to berberine, to sodium caprate, to behavioral tools, to the mere understanding of how the direct and indirect pathways go from the gut to dopamine, et cetera. If you're not establishing the firm foundation of proper metabolism, all of those things are going to be sort of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic as it's sometimes described.\n------------------------\n",

So the take-home message here is that as the author state, sleep and experiencing the different states of sleep, slow wave sleep early in the night predominantly, plus rapid eye movement sleep toward the end of the night is extremely important for optimizing metabolic circuits for human performance and health. In other words, by not getting sufficient duration sleep, you're not allowing your body and brain to transition through all the different aspects of fuel utilization, and you're not teaching your brain and body how to use similar types of fuels during wakefulness. So again, all of this points to the fact that we need to be getting sufficient quality and duration of sleep. So if you're sleep deprived, even by an hour or so, you're going to get far less rapid eye movement sleep because rapid eye movement sleep is what occurs toward the end of a sleep night. During the early part of the night, far more slow wave sleep.\n------------------------\n",

What does all this mean and how is this actionable? Well, on many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast, such as the Master Sleep episode and the episode that we're going into in further depth today, we're going to talk about sleep and how to optimize sleep. It's been thought of, but not really tamped down, that quality and depth of sleep and duration of sleep is important for metabolism during the daytime. And indeed, that's the case. If people are sleep deprived or they're not sleeping enough, things like glucose metabolism, et cetera, get really disrupted during the daytime. But what this current study shows is that the metabolism that you experienced during sleep, or to be more specific, the range of different types of metabolism that you experienced during sleep may serve to tune up or to ensure that the specific aspects of metabolism that you require during wakefulness are working properly.\n------------------------\n"

This awareness allows individuals to make proactive adjustments to their lifestyle to bolster their immune system and reduce the likelihood of succumbing to a cold or flu. Additionally, understanding these patterns can assist in implementing preventive measures to maintain overall health and well-being.",

            "\nShow Summary: In the \"How to Prevent & Treat Colds & Flu\" episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the biological and physiological aspects of colds and flus, and how they impact the body, particularly the immune system. He explains the mechanisms of the immune system in an accessible way, including the innate and adaptive responses, and how these can be bolstered to either prevent or treat colds and flus. Huberman debunks common myths about cold and flu treatments and highlights science-supported behavioral protocols and compounds for prevention and treatment. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the immune system to effectively combat these illnesses and provides insights into how lifestyle factors like sleep, stress, nutrition, and exercise can influence immune function.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: But it's something that I actually recommend people do, which is, you know, to pay attention to when you first started getting symptoms, pay attention to when you got over a given what you think is a colder flu, and then to look at what was happening in the days before and that day. I don't think it's possible to do hyper precise forensics on a cold or flu, right? I mean, you could have gone into the gas station, put your credit card in the machine to, you know, grab a drink out of the refrigerator and picked up a cold or flu from the handle of the refrigerator or from the credit card machine, or even from the gas pump. You simply don't know. However, if you look at the pattern of behavior, travel, sleep, exercise, sorts of interactions you were having prior to getting a bad cold or flu, chances are you're going to learn something interesting and be able to avoid getting a serious cold or flu, at least to some extent going forward. And I've done that, I think, fairly successfully because I can tell you that the frequency of colds or flus that I've come down with has indeed been dropping from year to year.\n------------------------\n",

You want to get into bed and sleep. If you can't sleep, you want to relax. You do not want to exercise. You should not exercise. Not only do you stand to get other people ill by going places where you exercise, but even if you exercise at home or in total isolation, you're going to prolong the duration of that illness because there are many, many reasons why being still, slowing your circulation and allowing your innate, and then in that case, your adaptive immune system to kick in and combat those infections is going to get you back into a regular exercise and work regimen much, much faster than would be the case if you were to push through. Okay, so now we get to the portion of the discussion that I think probably many people are anticipating, which is what can you take to reduce the probability of getting a cold or flu or shorten the duration of a cold or flu? And I actually put out a call on social media.\n------------------------\n",

Keep in mind, exercise is not a replacement for sleep. And then to allow you to get to sleep at the appropriate time later that night and back onto a regular schedule, keeping your innate immune system tuned up and ready to combat any colds or flus. Now, one more point about exercise. And here, we're also going to dovetail in an important point about nutrition. In the review that I mentioned a few moments ago, they cover some of the data from studies exploring the post-exercise stress response. So this is the post-exercise induced increase in things like cortisol, those natural killer cells, the production of white blood cells, and so on. It's very clear that if you are in a state of chronic stress because you're exercising a lot and or because you're not sleeping enough, or for whatever reason, maybe you have a lot of life stress, it's very clear that ingesting carbohydrates after exercise can help attenuate some of the inflammation that exercise induces. When we talk about carbohydrates, we're talking about rice, oatmeal, pasta, those sorts of things, so-called complex carbohydrates.\n------------------------\n"
