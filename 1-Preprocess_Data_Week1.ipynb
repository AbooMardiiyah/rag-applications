       "\"Right now, one of the things that has me the most unnerved is the attack on the dollar. So you've got the BRICS nations, for people that haven't heard that acronym before, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are getting together. And I know this has been going on for quite some time, so I don't know if I should be overly paranoid about that in this moment or not. But again, going back to those indicators that point to a transition from phase five to phase six, do you think there's anything that we can prepare for as we look at the big cycle, as we see this particular moment with the assault on the dollar? Is there anything in the big cycle that can educate us on how to deal with this moment? Just all happens over and over. The decline of the British pound as a reserve currency, and before that, the decline of the Dutch guilder as a reserve currency, all happened for the same reasons, which is, you know, two things are going on. First of all, they're holding all of this dollars and the stuff that we talked about is going on. And then also, there's the weaponization through sanctions of the dollar. In other words, the United States' greatest weapon to use, as distinct from its military weapon, is sanctions. And so, sanctions mean you freeze other assets, you freeze assets, and those assets are the bonds. And so, that happened with Russia, and there are threats of it with other countries, China and so on. And there's kind of the thinking, well, if I hold the bonds, can I be, can that happen to me? And then why am I transacting in this other third currency, rather than transacting directly? So, for example, the United States' share of world trade has declined, and China's share of world trade has increased to become greater. And so, if two countries are trading, let's say Saudi Arabia is trading with China, why do they go to the dollars in order to do that? You know, there's no good reason to go to the dollars, and then they're worried about holding the dollars, because they might get sanctioned. And so, you see more of those transactions taking place in other currencies, and then the usefulness of the dollar as a storehold of wealth changes. It's like, think about it in, you know, the most fundamental way. Everybody wants a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth. So, in other words, if everybody's using the dollar in world trade, then you want to save in dollars, because you say, okay, now that's the thing I spend in, and I save in the dollars. But over time, as the share of world trade goes down, why aren't they denominating in who, like China has a larger share of world trade. Traditionally, the countries that have the world's reserve currency have the largest share of world trade and the largest share of world capital flows. And because the United States has declined, and also there's a worry about that, holding it because of sanctions. I mean, just imagine how the Chinese must feel about having a lot of money in treasury bonds. You know, like, I would be worried that I would, like, be treated like Russia would be treated. It's not something I would want to hold as, you know, a safe asset. And other countries, like, who might feel that they can get sanctioned. And for all those reasons, they're less inclined to hold. And when we call dollars, what we're really calling is dollar debt. Because you don't hold, you hold dollar debt. And that's a, what is a debt? It's a promise to receive currency. So, okay, so now getting out of those things and transacting in other currencies seems to be the safer thing to do for those countries. And so that's the dynamic that's taking place. So it's not an attack on the dollar. It's like, I don't want to hold those things. And so very similar to on the British pound, you know, what happened is the British had the war, and they were the most powerful empire ever in the world. And they had World War II, and they came out of World War II financially in debt, a lot of debt. And who held the debt? All these countries held the debt, because that was the residual from that. But they had a problem. They had a debt problem. And so they needed to print more money because it was too much of a squeeze. And then you had, so it deteriorated. And they, you know, they sort of said, please hold my debt, please hold my debt. They went to Commonwealth countries, the part of those that were in the former British Empire. And then you had the Suez Canal incident, where there's sort of a war, and everybody realizes, well, hey, wait a second, that British Empire ain't the British Empire, and they're heavily in debt. And then they say, I don't want to own that debt. And there went the British pound. So that's just how the mechanics work. Okay, so looking at the US, and I don't want to be cheeky and say speaking directly to the, you know, the US government, but if I were to be so bold, so if this is that predictable moment, where, okay, there are actions that we can take as a country that will either help us keep the world reserve currency status, and there are actions that we can take that will cause us to lose that status more quickly. It seems like, okay, you've got the BRICS nations, they are moving away from the dollar. It seems like that has already, that card has already been played. I don't know if you think there's anything that we can do to make that easier. But certainly, speaking to printing, so one thing that I've heard recently, and this is a really fascinating concept, that when you have other nations that are holding your currency, holding debt, as you said, they're not like hoarding cash, but they're holding a lot of debt. If we print money, what we're essentially doing is externalizing inflation. So we are causing a devaluation of that debt for all the countries that hold us. Now, we're in a moment with rising interest rates, that's causing us to need to print, but creating this really weird, difficult moment where as we print, then we have a need to raise interest rates. But the reason we're having to print is because we're raising interest rates, so it's a very difficult moment. But if we could, going back to your idea, it's how we are with each other. If we could get people to come together in the middle, would one of the things we would want to convince the U.S. government to do is to be very cautious about devaluing the dollar? Is that an important idea? It's more basic than that, and it's more simple, but it's also more difficult. The reason cycles exist is that the next stage has been determined by what has already happened in the prior stage. So we are in debt a lot. You can't change that. We've got a lot of debt. And if you say, what could you do? I mean, two things come to mind. What you could do is you could be financially strong, and you can not use financial sanctions as a weapon to scare the holders of those bonds. But to be financially strong requires you to not spend more than you earn. That means you either have to cut your spending or raise your earnings. Okay, that ain't easy. Okay, so are we going to cut our spending? Okay, now you look at it. What are you going to do? Infrastructure programs, I don't know, poverty transfers, defense spending. Okay, what are we going to cut? Governments have the same basic economics as people except for the fact that they could take money from one person and give it to another, and they can print money. That's it. And so when you look at this, okay, you have that gap. You can eliminate the gap by taking money from some and eliminating another and not spending much. Okay, okay, that's not easy, right? Okay, okay, what are you going to do? Most governments now don't think, how much money do I have to spend, and then how do I prioritize that? They think, I need to spend on this, I need to spend on that, and I need to spend on that, and they spend on it, and then they either produce a deficit, and then you either have to pay it back with hard money or printed money, and that's the situation. So when you say, what could we do? Well, you've got to get financially strong in a politically fragmented environment in which everybody wants more, and you have to be a higher percentage of world trade so that everybody wants to use your currency and not threaten the holders of that bonds with freezing their assets. It's a tall order in this moment. It has become so clear to me in the last month since you and I saw each other, how important, the reason that you keep coming back to it all comes down to how people treat each other. So in this moment, I don't want to be a Debbie Downer, but it does feel like the die is cast a little bit. I don't see how we pull ourselves back from the precipice because, to your point about being fiscally responsible, we'd have to get into a position where we're making more than we spend. I want to circle around to something. As you were talking, you mentioned infrastructure, and it got me thinking about, okay, what are things that we would need to go right? So I think everybody is aware, and I've heard you say that there are changes that are going to need to be made to capitalism in order to bring back a thriving middle class and the importance of the thriving middle class. And you've defined the things, again, staying to the theme of principles here, of the three things that we need to do to be strong as a country or for any country to be strong. And you said two parents in the home, great public education, and then equal opportunity. Where do you see us on those? Are we moving in the right direction, moving in the wrong direction? Well, again, maybe I aspire too much to two parents in the home. It's certainly better if you have two loving parents raising a family, that's good. But maybe that's too much to ask for. But in other words, good parental guidance. Okay, you're raised well, you're educated well, you can go to a public school that educates you well, and you have good guidance. So you're well raised in a healthy environment. And not only do you learn, you know, skills and all that, but you learn how to behave well with each other. So you learn civility. And so you come out capable and civil to a land of opportunity in which you can, you know, work and have a good environment. And really, that's all you need if a society does that, right? And I think you know where we, you know, the things that are going on, you know. Education in a lot of public education is deteriorating, it's a real problem. My wife works to help the poorest school districts, the poorest people in the state of Connecticut. And the state of Connecticut is usually, it's always one, two or three in terms of the highest per capita income. And in the state of Connecticut, as of last survey, 22% of the high school students have either dropped out of high school or have absentee rates which are greater than 25% and are failing classes. So they're living in areas that don't have the things I'm talking about, about parents, nutrition, and so on. And there's not adequate resources for them. For example, during COVID, we found that 60,000 students didn't have computers or connectivities to take classes. And the government wasn't going to provide it. So philanthropically, we bought 60,000 computers and give it to the kids and we can't do that. So our society is, when you look at this, you see drugs, drug problems, you see how the cities are changing, you know, the cleanliness of the cities, the education levels of the cities, mental illness, crimes, and so on. You're not seeing, you know, you're seeing people fighting with each other a lot. Not all the time. There are wonderful places in the United States, you know, education, some of the best universities, their pockets, some of the, you know, their neighborhoods, but there is this encroaching. So you see infrastructure breaking down, school shootings, you know, like, okay, so you decide how we do it. To hear more about Ray Dalio's warning on the upcoming recession, which we're almost certainly already in, watch the full episode here. Talk to me about the three forces that you see that are influencing this moment. We've got banks collapsing, U.S. dollars under attack, looming recession, what...\\n\""

       " 'content': \"what are the near-term disruptions? The one that freaks me out, and every time I talk to a parent with a teenage boy, I'm like, your kid is like, sex robots are really gonna be a thing for them, like for real, for real. I worry if I grew up five years from now, I would not graduate from high school. I would just find a sex robot and go into oblivion. What are one, what do you think is the reality of that one in particular? And then I'd love to branch out to some others. So the word robot is interesting, but sex alternatives, for sure. I mean, get yourself an Apple Vision Pro or a Quest 3 and see how realistic your desired other gender is, right? It's just incredible. I mean, again, just think about all of the illusions that we're now unable to decipher illusion from truth, right? Sex happens in the brain at the end of the day. I mean, the physical side of it is not that difficult to simulate, okay? But if we can convince you that this sex robot is alive or that sex experience in a virtual reality headset or an augmented reality headset is alive, is real, then there you go. Go a few years further and think of Neuralink and other ways of connecting directly to your nervous system. And why would you need another being in the first place? You know, that's actually quite messy. It's all signals in your brain that you enjoy companionship and sexuality. And if you really want to take the magic out of it, okay, yeah, it can be simulated. Just like we can now simulate very, very easily how to move muscles. And, you know, there are so many ways where you can copy the brain signals that would move your hand in a certain way and just, you know, give it back to your hand and it will move the same way. It's not that complicated. There are, you know, so that whole idea of interacting with a totally new form of being. And once again, there is that huge debate of are they sentient or not? Does it really matter if they're simulating sentientism so well, okay? Does it really matter if the Morgan Freeman talking to you on the screen is actually Morgan Freeman or an AI-generated avatar if you're convinced that it is Morgan Freeman? This is the whole game. The whole game is we get lost in those conversations of, you know, are they alive? Are they sentient? It doesn't matter. If my brain believes they are, they are. And we're getting there. We're getting there so quickly. Companionship in general. I mean, there was a release of ChatGPT on Snapchat, okay? And kids chat with it as a friend. They don't really, I mean, of course they do somewhere deep in their mind distinguish that this is not really a human, but what do they care? The other person on the other side was never a human anyway. It was just a stream of texts and emojis and funny images. Wow. Yeah. So, and again, look, I'm an old man. I used a rotary phone in my young years. I coded mainframes. But when you really think about it, as much as I never imagined and I resisted, you know, should my kids have tablets or not? Should I have a free-to-air satellite television at home or not every time a new technology was coming out? And eventually we all managed to live with this. But let's just say this is a very significant redesign of society. It's a very significant redesign of love and relationships. And because there is money in it, what would prevent the next dating app from giving you avatars to date? There is money in it. A lot of people will try it. There are more than 2 million people on replica. Whoa. Given how many deaths of despair there are, do you think that that will ultimately be for better or worse that AI will be able to provide companionship for anybody that needs it? It's just eerie. I don't know if it's better or worse. I mean, I have a friend that I met for the first time at a concert in the UK, and we just had a wonderful time, and we haven't met since. But we chat all the time on Instagram, or sorry, on WhatsApp or whatever. And it's wonderful. It feels like a wonderful connection. If I didn't know it was a human, but the chat was that same quality, would it improve my human experience? A little bit. But has all of that small screen interaction improved humanity at large? The consensus is it hasn't, that we're more lonely today, even though we have 10x more friends on our friends list, that teen suicide is at an all-time high, that female suicide is at an all-time high. Obviously, the companies that will create those things will position them as the noble approach to help humanity. But at the end of the day, read Freakonomics. This is the noble approach for the company to make more money. That's it, right? Well, we want to sell it as this is good for humanity so that we hire more developers, and we convince the consumers, and we can stand on TED Talk stages and give larger-than-life speeches and so on. But end of the day, it's all about making more money. And I think reality is it's not good for humanity so far, so again, if you extrapolate that chart, it's going to be worse for humanity. Long-term, I don't know. Maybe those robots will be much nicer than a girlfriend. I don't know. So I've heard you use the example a lot of times. In fact, you mentioned it in this interview that you want to give AI the sort of value system of, gosh, it's somewhere in India, where you said people would come to the US, they would get educated to get these incredibly high-paying jobs, wildly intelligent people. You'd ping them to go grab a coffee, and they're like, oh, I've moved back to India. Why? To take care of my parents, just self-evident. So I don't have kids, and one of the things that I've really had to think about is when I'm 80, that ain't going to be cool. I'm not going to have somebody that's coming by to check up on me. And I just thought, oh, by the time I'm 80, assuming that the robots don't kill us, I'll be able to wear whatever the Apple Vision Pro of the moment is. And when the robot walks into my room, it will look exactly like the avatar looks through my glasses, and it will be able to care for me. I'll build a relationship with it over time. It will be tailored to my wants and desires. So it'll become the best of the best friends that I could ever hope for, or I could even program it to be like a child to me. And so it is like my kids coming to visit, whenever I want them to. I won't lie. It is, I definitely don't think it's better than kids. And I think that most people should have kids. I want to be very clear. But at the same time, given that I did not have kids, I am very grateful that the odds of something like that existing border on 100%. What do you think about that? Is that going to be like, does that further crater population problems because people are going to go, oh, Tom's right. I don't need to have kids. I don't need to have AI kids. Can I answer that question with my heart, not my brain? So the soul that you spoke to, it's the blue pill, red pill, right? It's the blue pill, red pill. And I think it's a very interesting philosophical question of should Neo have ever taken the red pill? You know, he had a life, okay? And the issue with humanity at large, Tom, is that we have failed because of how much life has spoiled us to accept what life gives us, okay? And in my other work on happiness, I will tell you openly that happiness is not getting what you want. It's not about getting what you want. It's about loving what you have, okay? And so the more we fall in that trap of make my life easier, make my life easier, make my life easier, make my life easier, there will always be something in that life that is not easier, okay? You know, there was that movie, I don't remember what it was, or I maybe heard of it, where, you know, someone dies, goes to heaven, and then gets like a wish. And basically the wish is, I wanna be a winner in the Vegas casino. So he spends every day, he walks into the casino and makes money and makes money and makes money. And as he makes money, you know, more girls are interested in him and da, da, da, da, da. And then eventually he starts to wake up one day and say, can I not lose money someday? Like, this is really boring, okay? Humans, we are who we are. It's not getting more things. It's not the tech company's approach of let's make things easier all the time that's ever gonna make us happier. You gotta give people the punchline of that episode. It's absolutely phenomenal. Yeah, it is. There is a point at which more progress is hurting us at the community level. It's also hurting us at the individual's ability to stay healthy when life is not what we want. And life is about to become a lot different than what we want, just because we constantly want more and more and more. Life, at the end of the day, I just always want to remind people that there is no other way in my mind. I mean, I want to be proven wrong. Please prove me wrong. That the separation of power and wealth that is about to come in a world with such a superpower is science fiction-like, okay? That the challenge to jobs and income and purpose is science fiction-like. These are very dystopian images of society. What for? Because we want our vision pro to create a reality that is not our reality. If you want to learn more about this topic, check out this interview. We've never created a nuclear weapon that can create nuclear weapons. The artificial intelligences that we're building are capable of creating other artificial intelligences. As a matter of fact, they're encouraged to create other artificial intelligences, even if...\\n\",\n",

    "In the Impact Theory episode featuring Ray Dalio, a renowned billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, a wide range of topics is explored, with a central focus on the global economic landscape and the challenges it currently faces. The conversation between Tom Bilyeu and Ray Dalio delves into various aspects of economics, geopolitics, and the dynamics that shape our world today.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary concerns highlighted in the discussion is the vulnerability of the U.S. dollar. Ray Dalio expresses his unease regarding the ongoing international efforts by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to reduce their reliance on the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. He emphasizes that this shift is not an outright attack on the dollar but rather a reflection of the changing economic landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dalio draws parallels between historical events where other reserve currencies, such as the British pound and the Dutch guilder, lost their dominance due to a combination of factors, including holding excessive amounts of the currency and concerns over potential sanctions. He explains that countries are now looking for alternatives to transact in, driven by a desire to avoid the risks associated with holding large amounts of dollar-denominated debt and the potential for sanctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion also touches on the importance of financial responsibility for countries, suggesting that being financially strong is crucial in this evolving global environment. The idea of externalizing inflation through currency devaluation is explored, along with the complex interplay between interest rates, money printing, and fiscal responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the conversation, Ray Dalio emphasizes that understanding the historical context and the cyclical nature of economic events is crucial. He advocates for principles like strong family structures, quality education, and equal opportunities as foundational elements for a thriving middle class and a prosperous society. However, he acknowledges that achieving these principles in today's complex world is challenging, particularly when it comes to addressing issues like education inequality and poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Impact Theory episode featuring Ray Dalio provides valuable insights into the current state of the global economy and the challenges it faces. Dalio's expertise and historical perspective shed light on the potential vulnerabilities of the U.S. dollar and the importance of financial responsibility for nations. The conversation serves as a reminder of the complex interplay of economic forces, geopolitics, and social factors that shape our world, and it underscores the significance of addressing these challenges to ensure a prosperous future.\n",
