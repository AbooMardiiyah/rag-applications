       " 'content': \"What we put in our bodies impacts our health, our lifespan, our mental state. We live in a world where there are so many choices. The vast majority of choices are not great choices. People will often take the path of least resistance, and they'll get the fastest, most available food for their day. In many cases, what they're doing is they're poisoning themselves. Dr. Bob Harari, welcome to the show. Tom, good to see you, and it's a privilege to be here in your beautiful, beautiful studio. Thank you, man. I want to know, what are three things that people do daily that shorten their lifespan? First and foremost, I think inactivity and a dependence on technology for physical activities is damaging. Dependence on technology? What do you mean? Even depending on motorized vehicles to drive to get three blocks to the store to pick up a gallon of milk. People need to be more physically active. They need to build and maintain their muscle mass. That's one of the most actionable things we can do to maintain our health. There's fundamental biological reasons for that we can talk about, but that to me is one of the principal, principal factors that if you just pay attention can impact your lifespan. All right, so lack of activity, diet, what else? The go-to is diet, right? A hundred percent. The go-to is diet. If you say it's not diet, those are going to be fighting words. I couldn't agree with you more. Bob, I'm going to come at you at the end of this. I was saving it for number three, but let's leave it at number two. There's no doubt what we put in our bodies impacts our health, our lifespan, our mental state, you name it. The problem is we live in a world where there are so many choices, and the vast majority of choices are not great choices. People will often take the path of least resistance, and they'll get the fastest, most available food for their day. In many cases, what they're doing is they're poisoning themselves. How do you feel about people that say a calorie is a calorie? It doesn't matter. I don't believe that at all. There's a very big difference between a calorie of protein versus a calorie of fat versus a calorie of carbohydrates. We know that, and we know that what you want to do is you want to provide yourself not just with energy, but you want to provide yourself with building blocks. The building blocks are essential to the repair and regenerative process, which is what I'm very focused on. You can't build new cells and new tissues and new organs unless you have the components that are necessary, and those components, for the most part, are found in proteins. Fats are very, very good because the byproduct of fat digestion gives you some of those building blocks. It's important to take into consideration that many of the things we eat have pro-inflammatory elements to them. At the end of the day, controlling inflammation and controlling the exposure your body has to the toxic nature of things like raw sugars clearly has a big impact. The reason you and I first became friends was how thrilled I was what you were doing a quest building these really fantastic products that were delicious, satisfied those cravings, but provided you with the building blocks I'm just talking about. So clearly, nutrition is something that people, unless they pay attention to it, may in fact be doing themselves harm rather than benefit. Do you have a rule of thumb on diet? You have 30 seconds to explain to somebody what to either do or not do, if they care about longevity specifically. Well, somebody who's always been plagued by a tendency to become overweight because of less than ideal activity and the wrong diet, I've decided that I'm going to focus on one thing that I know I can measure, and I'm going to use that as my metric to follow. For me, it's blood sugar. We all know, and I think it's increasingly recognized, that blood sugar is linked to metabolic inefficiency that exposes our entire system. Inefficiency? Why inefficiency? What's happening? So I eat a carbohydrate, for those that don't know, I eat a carbohydrate, doesn't matter if it's a carrot or it's a bread, whatever, some portion of that is going to break down into glucose. That's what we're talking about when we say blood sugar, because a lot of people think as long as it doesn't say sugar on the pack, that it's not going to be a problem. Now carrots was probably a terrible example because so much of that's blunted by fiber. But you're eating carbohydrates, they're going to end up in your bloodstream as glucose. But why does that cause metabolic inefficiency? The easier it is for what you ingest to become that free circulating glucose, the easier that is, the less efficient it is for you, for your system. What I mean by that is if your body has to go through a digestive process to turn the carbohydrate in a carrot into an absorbable form of glucose, that's better than if you get raw glucose just as a sugary coating on a product. Because if I have to work to get that glucose out of the product into my system, that's better. Is it better because it's slower or is it better because there's just less of it? Well, it's better because it's slower and because you're actually utilizing energy to do that digestive process. You're actually balancing the asymmetry between availability of glucose, the raw availability, and the usability of glucose. What I mean by that is I would rather you have to work a little bit to get the glucose out of a product than to just have an infusion of raw glucose into your bloodstream. Why does glucose cause so much inflammation? I think in part because as the food industry evolved, it was about quantity, not quality. The sugar plantations recognized it's real easy to grow sugarcane and grow other raw sources of glucose, molasses, et cetera, et cetera, and to put these into products in as simple a form as possible so that the process of making the product was easier and less expensive. That means that your exposure to these sugars is much, much higher than under normal biological circumstances. If we were back 2,000 years and we were foraging for food or growing our own food, the effort used to produce that helps burn some of this raw glucose that we're absorbing. The inefficiency in my mind is all about you don't want to fill your system with glucose you didn't pay for, and you didn't pay for energetically. That may not be the best description, but I just think about it. If you have to run before you get to the restaurant and order your meal, that's probably better for you. Going in, so we've got two things, not enough activity, a poor diet, a pro-inflammatory diet. Those are going to be problematic, pro-inflammatory, and the quick example would be high blood sugar diets or anything that's spiking your blood sugar consistently. What's one more thing? The third thing, to me, really relates to something else we put into our bodies, which is the medicines, the supplements, and the other things that we think are benefiting us, but might, in fact, not really be all that useful. Everybody I know takes some form of supplement, either in a pill form, a capsule form, in a powder form. We have to consider how that product got to be in the format we're ingesting it. Do you avoid supplements altogether? No, no, I don't, but I avoid, for example, as much as possible, the gelatin encapsulated supplements. People don't recognize that gelatin has to go through a process of being broken down, digested, in order to release the contents. I remember a situation where a gentleman who was very health conscious was ingesting a tremendous number of supplements a day, actually developed an obstruction in his intestinal system from gelatin. What? Yeah, yeah. That's a lot of supplements. That's a lot of supplements. By the way, it's not uncommon for people to take 20, 30, 40 capsules a day. Dude, there's people that take even more than that, which is crazy. I try not to supplement anything. Now, are you only ... So you're worried about quality of supplementation versus supplementation itself. Is it just the gelatin, or are there other things that people are ingesting? What are typical ones that mess with people? I think that if you don't look at all of the components of what you put in your body, some of the other ingredients, they may be binding agents. They may be excipients that improve the solubility of the product. Any of those things that you're putting in your body, although they're a minor ingredient of the supplement, they do, over time, have an effect. You have to pay attention to this. You and I were just talking about the concept of whole food, whole, real, natural, unadulterated forms of food helps avoid some of those added ingredients you don't need. You may get your 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C, but if the vitamin C tablet you take is bound together by an algae-based or gelatin-based component, you have to consider that's going in your body as well. When you think about aging and people doing things that are decreasing their life, are we doing things that are ... I think a lot about methylation of the DNA. People have heard me talk about this a lot, but for people that are hearing this for the first time, in every cell, you've got the DNA, which is the program that tells your cells what to do, but over time, there's little misreads, mistakes in the replication, and you've got these little things, which I never remember what they're called, but they run along and they mark, like, this part should be red for this cell. This is a liver cell, so only this part of the DNA should be exposed and should be red, and as that begins to get confused and the bookmarks get put in the wrong place, the cell starts to de-differentiate, and as we de-differentiate, we age. One, did I capture that idea correctly, and then two, as you think about people doing things that shorten their life, is that effective what they're doing? They're doing things that cause the wrapping of the DNA to be wrapped or marked poorly, or is it something else entirely? So you're hitting on a topic that's near and dear to my heart, and may I expand on it a little bit? Please. Educate me, because I know it just enough to be dangerous, but take me to the deep waters. It's almost like I primed this entire conversation. Every cell in our body can be thought of as a computer, a computer that has in the nucleus all of the biological software which drives the processes that provide all the synthetic products of the cell, proteins, peptides, et cetera, and also drives the sequence of events necessary for that cell to continue to perform its function, whether it's a liver cell or a heart cell or a brain cell. That software can get corrupted. It gets corrupted through normal processes as well as abnormal processes. That in effect means the software doesn't get read properly. Give me an example of an abnormal process. A mutation induced by a virus. One of the ways that viruses actually create the symptoms is they begin to destroy your cells by taking over the machinery in the cell, actually damaging that cell's ability to replicate normally, and fortunately our immune system will come in and clean that out, and fortunately not all your cells necessarily are affected. Viruses can cause these mutations and abnormalities. Exposure to radiation, ionizing radiation, can obviously do that, and then there's evidence that chemicals we ingest, maybe some of the things we've been talking about, some of those chemicals might in fact either stimulate or prolong what we call the epigenetic changes to our DNA which affects the performance of the cell. Just to get back to what you were sort of alluding to, if our software, in order to run properly, has to be uncorrupted, anything that corrupts the software, just like the software in your computer, if it gets corrupted, your program doesn't run properly. That same process occurs in our cells, and if you think about the nucleus is where the software resides, and the cytoplasm of the cell, the body of the cell, is where the processing takes place, and if you think of the surface of the cell as the keyboard, then that kind of model of the cell as a computer means that what's the best way to protect yourself is to keep your master boot disk stored away somewhere so that it can't be damaged. As a way of protecting the integrity of that software as early in life as possible in the event you need to reboot your system. One of the things that I want to answer today is if stem cells are as amazing as you would have me believe, why don't I see super soldiers running around? Why don't 100-year-olds look 25? But before we get to that, I just want to prime the audience that that's one of the places we're going to go, but I really want to understand how the cell operates. So I've got the nucleus, all the DNA is jammed in there. I've got the cytoplasm, is that what you called it? How is it doing the processing? The more I can envision this, the more I'll be able to remember it. So I have maybe a slight understanding of the way that DNA is read, but I don't understand how the processing is happening in the cytoplasm. What's actually going on? Not metaphor, what's actually happening? So the DNA has a partner in cellular processes called RNA. That's what's in the cytoplasm? So RNA transit between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. And there are little things that move around. There are little nucleic acids, there are little pieces of nucleic acid that copy the corresponding sequence from the DNA. Can they move? Oh, absolutely. They traffic around the cell. They actually move through pores in the nuclear membrane. And are they like, if I was looking at them for people watching, you can see my hand, for people listening, I'm like doing a crawling motion. How do they actually ambulate, is that the word? They don't traffic by their own motion. What they do is they move sort of through Brownian motion. They float. What the hell is Brownian motion? I don't want to get into chemistry. I want to understand it though. So they're not just sloshing around. They must have like, they're doing something willfully. And now I know I'm getting into metaphor because obviously they're not, they don't have a nervous system or anything like that. If I was looking at them under a microscope, I would see them move, right? Traffic. So you can see RNAs, these little molecules of ribonucleic acid that first, the way the RNA is created is that they actually come up to the DNA itself and they create a corresponding sequence to that DNA that's now... And they're just grabbing that shit out of the floaty stuff, right? They're just grabbing those letters and going up, C, C, T, T, G, G, right? That's right. They have a correspondence so that the sequence of DNA is written onto the RNA. The RNA then traffics from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and it attaches to parts of the cell cytoplasm called ribosomes. And those ribosomes are the place in which the RNA is translated into protein, okay? That's where the cell's gonna split? So no, that's... So we're talking about two different things. We're talking about protein synthesis from your... That's encoded in your DNA, the... So the DNA says, create this protein. Exactly. Exactly. So the genes for a specific protein... How does it end up getting out of the cytoplasm or does it? It does. So the ribosome allows the mRNA, the messenger RNA. So the first step is you transcribe the message from the DNA to the RNA. Then the RNA traffics, transits into the cytoplasm... With the copy of that protein. With the recipe. Okay. Think of it as a... It just has the recipe. It doesn't actually have the protein yet. It doesn't have the protein yet. Got it. So I now have the recipe. So I wrote down the recipe. That's right. Now I go into the cytoplasm. That's right. Then this little molecule that constitutes the ribosome allows for that messenger RNA to be translated into a sequence of amino acids. And if you ever watch the process, it's a fascinating process. It looks very mechanical. And the translation of the message from the gene in the DNA says, make this particular protein. Make growth hormone. The growth hormone recipe, which is encoded in the DNA and transcribed to the mRNA and then translated to the protein in the cytoplasm, takes place on a piece of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. This is a little... I was going to guess that. Well, this is a little organelle. And by the way, it's a good name for your next dog, reticulum. Organelle is a good name too. But once you translate into the sequence of amino acids and you now have a length of amino acids that constitute a protein, the protein then gets packaged in part of the cell, an organelle called the Golgi apparatus. And the Golgi apparatus puts layers of cell membrane around this new protein. That protein then gets connected to the cell membrane itself, where it can be expelled into the extracellular space. That's how proteins go from recipe, to design, to production, to secretion. Okay. So now once it's outside of this cell, it's going to... I assume it's made locally. So muscle cells are going to make the protein that I need to affix to the muscle in order to make it bigger, repair damage, whatever the case may be. How does it go from, you're now free my child, to being used in the way that it's intended? So that's the beauty of biology, okay? So the system is designed to read and express genes that are necessary for certain functions. And we don't fully understand the process by which those genes are turned on and turned off, but there is a series of signaling events that calls upon the production. So for example, while you're growing, the need for growth hormone actually commands the expression of those proteins that then get produced and then secreted, and they now influence the cells around them, and in some cases, even remotely, by transiting through the bloodstream to go and affect cells in the rest of the body. That's called the paracrine effect, okay? And then the autocrine effect, where your single cell may drive functions in cells all around it, as well as distant to that. Okay, so this shit is insanely complicated. Very complicated. I've said this probably a dozen times on the show, if you want to believe in God, look inside the cell. This stuff is so crazy and complicated, it is unbelievable. But all right, cool. So that was an amazing walkthrough. I actually want to now look at this under a microscope to see what it actually looks like. Well, the beauty is, I'm going to send you some remarkable videos where artists have actually created computerized graphic representations of this process, and when you actually see it, you'll say, how could that possibly have been designed? It is so intricate, and it is so elegant. Literally, some of the molecules necessary for reading and writing the DNA walk. These molecules walk. You had that little description. Ambulate. Ambulate. They literally walk across the DNA, the chromatin. What are those called? Polymerases. DNA polymerases. It's amazing, remarkable stuff. Believe me, I'm a surgeon, so this is probably way above my pay grade, but the fact is, we recognize that every cell is a synthetic factory that produces products encoded in the DNA, and those products are necessary not just for the function of that cell, but for the function and integrity of the cells around it, and to influence cells even far away, other parts of the body. Okay, so knowing that your specialty is stem cells, so what is it that stem cells are doing in that process? So for people that don't know, the brief history of stem cells is that they can become anything. So when we're first developing the placenta ... In fact, tell people, because this is a very fascinating take on the placenta, walk people through the early insight that you had that made you think, placentas aren't what people think they are.

Back in the early part of my professional medical career, my entire focus was on the treatment of head and spinal cord injury. I was ... Didn't it seem futile at the time? Well, it was very depressing. When you started, that had to be just like, oh, sorry, you got hit in the head, you're done. What made you think you could be helpful? Well, you know, maybe it was a little bit of optimism combined with fearlessness, the fact that the outcomes were so bad after traumatic brain injury, we couldn't do much worse. As an engineer by training, I tried to break it down to the root cause of why people do badly after traumatic brain injuries. My partner at the time was a brilliant neurosurgeon up here at Stanford now, Jam Gajar. We built a laboratory where we studied these processes. How many living brains have you poked around on? Too many to remember. Living? Yeah. Yeah. And virtually all of them ... This is the creepiest shit ever. And virtually all of them were the victims of some traumatic event where we knew that if we could control the post-traumatic inflammatory process ... So, the immune system response becomes the bigger problem? There's no doubt everything associated with the health, wellness, repairability, and recoverability in our body is driven by the immune system. The immune system is designed to interrogate, to make sure things are working properly, and then respond when they're not. And so, in the case of a traumatic brain injury, the mechanical insult to your brain disrupts, even at the cellular level, the integrity of those living cells. And we showed this. We actually created ... You're going to love this. Tom, we actually created a model in the laboratory to replicate what happens in a car accident by creating a water-filled piston that was percussed by a hammer, and the shock wave was transmitted through this connection into an experimental brain in order to compress the brain the way it does when the head hits a windshield. And what we found was that that perturbation of the cell released factors which stimulated and recruited cells from the inflammatory system, from the immune system, to come in and release factors which disrupted the blood-brain barrier and caused brain swelling, and affected the integrity of the cerebrovascular system, the blood supply to the brain. What people were dying from after traumatic brain injury was unchecked brain swelling. Now, what happens if you bang your arm in the car door when you're leaving tonight? It's going to hurt. It's going to swell up. Fortunately, for most of our body, the swelling can occur without encroaching upon any of the anatomic structures, but not the brain. The brain is encased in a rigid skull, which means that as the pressure builds because of swelling, what happens? Either the brain gets squeezed out of the skull, and that actually happens. It's called a herniation. Oh, God. Oh, yeah. Where does it go? Well, remember you have this hole at the bottom of your skull called the foramen magnum, and that's where your brain connects to your spinal cord. Believe it or not, your brain can be squeezed out through that little tiny hole. Oh. Yeah, yeah. That's horrifying. Not a good thing. Will it shrink back, or is that like once it's there, it is all over? If you've progressed to that point, it's pretty far along, but here's the interesting thing. The brain as an anatomical structure has brain tissue, it has blood vessels, and it has fluid. The fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. If you think about it, you have three things in a box. You need the brain tissue, and you need the blood. If you squeeze the blood out, you get a stroke. The fluid that's in there, the cerebrospinal fluid, if you can get that out, you can make room for the brain to swell a little bit. What we actually were very focused on early on is control of intracranial pressure. That was a plumbing problem. By draining that fluid. By just getting a catheter into that system and draining that fluid. With my partner and our team, we actually looked at device strategies to help doctors in the acute environment control that pressure. Okay, I'm going to walk through. This is so fascinating. My audience will have to forgive if they don't care, but this is really interesting to me. You're in an ER. Somebody just got in a car accident. They have battered their head. They come in, presumably unconscious. Do you cut their head open? What are you doing? Let's say I don't understand the fluid part. I would think you got to take the top off the head and just let the brain swell. That was old fashioned. Believe it or not, if you go back historically in the management of traumatic brain injury and uncontrollable brain swelling, one of the strategies was to do a craniotomy, craniectomy, removing the skull and allowing the brain to swell out. In some cases, actually removing part of the brain. That seems really bad. Well, it's a last ditch effort to make enough room so that the rest of the brain can potentially be salvaged. It doesn't always work that way. You can imagine removing a significant portion of brain tissue has significant consequences. How long can you leave a brain exposed like that? Again, it depends upon the surgical environment and the surgical skill set and so on. In some cases, surgeons will remove part of the skull and just cover the scalp back over in order to give time for the swelling to subside. A day? Pardon me? An hour? It all depends on the situation. It depends upon the extent of the injury to begin with. It depends upon the underlying inflammatory state of the individual. Suffice it to say, that's not the ideal way to manage that problem. That sounds unideal. As I mentioned, my partner that I worked with, Jam Gajar, we were very fascinated by the fact that you have an acute window of opportunity to address this brain swelling. Could you do it by getting a proper drainage system into that fluid compartment of the brain and controlling pressure by relieving fluid? There's a specific place that that's happening? The fluids in your brain circulate around the outside of the brain. Got it. There's a system within the brain called the ventricular system. And the ventricular system are cavities. They're open spaces where the cerebral spinal fluid circulates. So if you can get a catheter in there and you can remove the fluid, you actually can get some control over the pressure. But it's complicated, right? You know, the old saying is that if you relieve the pressure too rapidly, you may actually exacerbate the problem and cause more brain swelling than existed before. That's surprising, but okay. So the bottom line is that technology to control brain pressure, control intracranial pressure, has impacted the management of traumatic brain injury considerably. But the generation that has evolved since then, because this is work we did in the 80s, since then is to mostly look at ways to control the inflammatory process. And by the way, there are some relatively straightforward approaches that appear to work. Hypothermia, you know, cooling tissues off actually helps control things like swelling. And then also using certain methods to reduce the metabolic demands of the brain will reduce the need for blood flow. How the f*** do you do that? Well, you've heard of induced comas. Yes. Okay? So if you have a patient who... And basically you're trying to shut the brain off? You're basically lowering the demand for blood supply. And by lowering demand for blood supply, you lower intracranial blood volume. If you lower intracranial blood volume along with intracranial pressure control by draining that fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, you can potentially manage this wave of swelling that occurs. And you want to get to a point where swelling starts to decline, you can restore blood flow, and you haven't damaged the brain so much that it can't recover. That was, you know, kind of the fundamental strategy behind all of this. Taking it a couple of steps forward, we now work in a world where there are tools to use to control inflammation. Some of those tools are pharmacologic tools or biologic tools. There are even methods that are mechanical that are being developed, you know, methods that use certain pressure differentials and so on. All that being said, I'm at the point in my life, I'm more concerned about, okay, after all these acute events, what can I do to restore function in these patients? And now I assume we're looped back to stem cells. Thank you. So here's, I'm bitter about stem cells. So I don't know if this is just, it's still early days or what, but I want to see 100-year-olds go backwards to looking like 25-year-olds. And I know Tony's story, it's amazing. But like, do you think that there is going to be progress and understanding of like the, so let me back up. I'm going to make a hypothesis. Here's how I look at it. Stem cells can become anything, but stem cells are not the only part of what's going on inside the placenta, which we actually didn't even get to that part I derailed you. So we're going to have to walk through, okay, what was your insight around the stem cell? And then why my hypothesis is going to be that that what you're about to describe there, what's happening in the placenta is so fucking complicated that injecting someone with stem cells is like 5% of that milieu and that we would have to get into sequencing different like chemistry and signals and all kinds of stuff if we really want to have radical transformation. But give us that first insight. And this time I will try to stay on task as you explain why it isn't what people originally thought. You're hitting upon some really important opportunities to distinguish what we think the history was and what it really was. For decades now, biologists, scientists, and clinical people have recognized that since we all start from a single cell and that single cell has all of the information and all of the ability to produce every mature specialized cell type of our body and do it at such scale that from a single cell in your lifetime, tens of trillions of cells are produced. What is the fundamental unit, if you will, that's responsible for that level of differentiation, specialization, scale, and integrity? If you think about it, right, every cell in our body, Tom, originated from a cell that originated in the placenta. So you know, Peter Diamandis and I, I think you and I, Peter probably sat around talking about that the placenta is nature's 3D printer, it prints the newborn baby. In doing so, it deposits cells that will take up residence and give off progeny that will populate that developing human being for the rest of their lifetime. If you think about that, right, from one cell to tens of trillions of cells in our lifetime, how perfect does all of that information resident in the cell have to be and how perfect have those systems have to be in order to support that level of expansion and differentiation and propagation? So I was fascinated by that because I said, well, you know, couldn't every disease and every illness and every injury in our body be addressed simply by replacing the damaged or diseased cells? And if you can do that, what tool would you need to do that? So when stem cells first emerged in the scientific literature, I was fascinated by the possibility that I could use them to restore the functions that are lost after a bad brain injury. The problem is, what was the tool that I would use? Where would I get it from? Could I produce it to a form that the average clinical community could utilize? Because let's face it, it's one thing to do work in a laboratory and to have discoveries and develop some interesting theories that you test at the bench. It's a whole other ball game putting it in the hands of a clinician to use to treat hundreds or thousands of patients in their professional career. That's why the industry of pharmaceuticals has grown to where it is, because what the pharmaceutical industry does is it puts tools in the hands of clinicians. If you go back a couple hundred years, doctors had to make their own medicines. So if you think of cells as a medicine, as a biological medicine, I had to figure out a place to get them. Where could you source these cells? And what would you have to do to turn those cells into a product that was of the quality, the consistency, the reliability, and the scalability and economics to fit our health care system? So if you go back 25, 30 years when most of the work around stem cells was being done on stem cells derived from human embryos that were discarded, or ... Hugely controversial. Very controversial. And by the way, aside from the moral and ethical debate around the use of embryos, consider that at the stage of an embryo's development where you isolate the cells, which is the blastocyst stage, it's very early in development. Although the embryo might look normal, only one out of four, one out of five embryos that reach the blastocyst stage ever go on to form a full, healthy newborn. Most of them spontaneously dissolute sometime after that blastocyst stage. Because the body detects a problem? Exactly. Because nature detects that the underlying quality of that embryo isn't good enough to make it all the way through. And it turns out that the most common reason for those early pregnancies from not continuing is that there's a fundamental defect in the genetic material of the developing embryo. So let me explain that. As you know, we are produced by an egg and a sperm, which have half the DNA content of a full cell, because when they recombine, they create the full content of DNA. Which means that the cells that are used, the egg and the sperm, are produced by a process called meiosis. Meiosis is different than mitosis. Mitosis is a cell makes an extra copy of its DNA and then splits. Mitosis is when a cell splits its DNA apart into two half portions of pasta. Okay? Alright? You know, when I go to an Italian restaurant, sometimes I want the bolognese, sometimes I want the carbonara. It's really nice when you can get half and half. That's sort of what happens in the cell after meiosis. The cells that make up the sperm or the egg are produced by tearing apart the chromosomes. When those chromosomes are torn apart, there are often mechanical defects. Those things are called deletions, translocations, trisomies, quatrosomies. All of the aberrant copies of your DNA that may be present in a blastocyst, but not capable of going all the way to a full complete pregnancy, is the reason why embryos are probably not the best source of cells. Because you don't know how good their quality is early on. Very interesting. So, so many of these things are dysfunctional. Anyway, going there, even if it wasn't a moral and ethical problem, still not a good idea. That's right. I made the commitment to one fundamental principle, which was, if you make it through a full term pregnancy and there's a healthy product of that pregnancy, a healthy newborn, that's gone through nature's quality control process, right? And so, if that's where I'm harvesting my cells to develop a cellular medicine, at least, I eliminated the potential problems that may have been carried through by using the wrong cell source. That's the way I looked at it. Makes sense. There's another insight that I've heard you talk about before, which goes to your point about the placenta being the 3D printer, but if people don't understand, like if they're lost at the level of analogy, they'll miss something really cool. So you were thinking about the placenta and the embryo, and you're like, well, they should grow at the same rate, but you looked at it and they don't. The placenta blows up, huge, massive resources go to the placenta, and then the embryo develops. That's interesting, because then you start thinking of, okay, the placenta is making all these stem cells, and the stem cells, in effect, and I know that this probably is not biologically accurate, but now this helps me picture why the placenta becomes so important. If it is a stem cell factory, A, stem cells are already coming, quote unquote, from the outside, so there's this thing, the placenta, creating the stem cells and basically sending them over to the fetus, then the fetus is going to grow. That would give me the, okay, well then, if I already know that it can get this injection, air quotes, from the placenta, then it might work later down the road. But it obviously has a way bigger impact in the placenta, so again, stealing your own story from you, spina bifida, the skin doesn't close for whatever reason, it's going to have horrible consequences if left unchecked, but you can actually do surgery on the fetus, which is already insane. All you have to do is close the skin and they will grow up normal, and P.S., they won't have a scar on their back, which is crazy. You had surgery, you have no scar, but if you do that to a one-year-old, presumably they would have a scar, and certainly do a six-year-old. I love it, Tom, because it means that all the time we spent together, you're paying more attention to me than I'm paying attention to you, which is fabulous. So here's what really intrigued me. So first and foremost, when my oldest daughter was in utero, and I ran down from the surgical ICU where I was covering to go and look at the first trimester ultrasound, and I saw that she was a peanut-sized embryo, but the placenta was already this developed organ and getting bigger, it dawned on me that, as an engineer, for it to be bigger, when I thought, from my early medical school training, that the placenta was a vascular interface between the developing fetus and the maternal system, they'd grow at the same rate. The maternal system. Right, right. It's a loving way to say mother. I'm trying to be as politically correct as possible. But I was fascinated by the fact that this, to me, indicated that the placenta was the governor of embryogenesis and fetogenesis, actually finishing the production of that newborn. Now, if that was the case, why? And it just seemed to me obvious, since the net change in cellular mass of a developing embryo to a fetus is enormous. Where does all that cellular mass come from? Some of it develops de novo in the developing embryo and fetus, but some has to come in there from this organ. That was my thesis, and so I started to look at the placenta and found that in this complicated organ was basically the anatomy of a bioreactor. It was basically a cultivation and cellular propagation environment. It was a nursery for developing cells, and since those cells had access to a circulatory system that could gain access to the developing fetus, some of them were clearly trafficking in and out of the fetus. And so I came up with this concept that, well, the placenta is basically nature's stem cell factory, and if it's nature's stem cell factory and we throw away in the world 150 million of these a year, is that maybe the best place to find cells for the emerging field of cellular medicine? That was the crazy idea, the crazy epiphany that I had looking at my daughter's first trimester ultrasound. Fast forward, we did the work to show that, in fact, the placenta is an environment for the propagation and expansion of these stem cells and their ultimate trafficking into the developing fetus. But after the fetus is separated, at birth, when you cut that umbilical cord and the newborn baby is no longer connected to the placenta, and that placenta comes out, is there any way of harvesting some of these surplus cells from the organ? And that's what we based all of our efforts in our company on 20 some odd years ago. And knock wood, we were fortunate that not only was it an ideal source of these cells, but I could develop systems to procure these leftovers. I could create what I call a procurement network where, in partnership with obstetric practices and birthing hospitals and expectant parents, we could ethically, morally, legally, and under high quality control, collect these organs that would normally just wind up in the waste basket. They'd wind up in the biohazardous waste material. And by the way, hospitals have to pay to get rid of them. I could recover these, bring them to the laboratory, extract the cells we need, and use those to produce the cellular medicines we were all dreaming of. At the genesis of this industry, that's what was really our driving force. So why don't I look 25 then? Well first of all, you look amazing. That's very generous. But 25 I do not look. Well I gotta tell you something, since the last time I saw you, you look more youthful and clearly, clearly like you're working, using this gym very effectively. Very kind. So here's where we are. Cellular medicine is a therapeutic platform, therapeutic technology, which goes through the same process of review, demonstration of safety and efficacy, and then ultimately approval by our Food and Drug Administration that other therapeutic products go through. As you can imagine, the modern FDA was designed to evaluate, test, and approve traditional therapeutics. Those are chemicals, discrete chemicals, and biologic products. Are you saying that they're just slowing you down? And like in reality, if you could just go crazy, like we really would have that kind of regeneration? I have, dude, I am the ignorant one at this table, but I have a feeling that there is sequencing, maybe not the right word, but something like that, where there's a whole bunch of things, whole bunch of contextual cues that the placenta has or sends out that cause stem cells to have the massive impact that they have, that maybe not impossible to replicate, but is decades in the future, as we learn all the nuances, or no, you think this is really a slowdown just from testing and approval? So the FDA and other regulatory bodies throughout the world have a very, very tough job on their hands, considering all of the theoretical technologies and then reduced to practice technologies that are looking to gain approval for broad clinical use. You have to ensure that you're exposing, you're using the right lens on those technologies to ensure safety first and foremost, and then you have to link that safe product to clear expectation of clinically meaningful benefit. What's often used, the term is efficacy. Now, discriminating between safety and efficacy is one thing. The other is, do you have the right metrics to use to determine whether something is clinically meaningful as a cellular medicine versus a biologic product versus a chemical? Because remember, if I put a chemical in your body and the chemical is going to block an enzyme, okay, there's what we call a stoichiometry, there's a mathematics- It's a word. It's a great word, too. I love that word. I use it all the time. The stoichiometry of will that particular product work, the chemical product, you can actually figure out you need so much of this chemical to block so much of this enzyme. That's how you come up with things like dose, and that's how you come up with things like interval or frequency of dosing. That's pharmacokinetics, okay? That pharmacokinetic analysis is what guides whether or not you give somebody five grams of aspirin or 80 milligrams of aspirin, okay? Okay. This is all going to answer the punchline of why I don't look 25? Yes. Okay. I'm working towards it. Keep going. I'm working towards it. With cells, the industry and the regulatory community took some time to better understand how would we even measure, how would we even determine the pharmacokinetics of cellular products because you don't just administer them and then they have a discrete function and nothing else. A living cell, a living cellular therapy is going to have many, many different biological activities based upon the environment it's introduced into, the health state of the recipient, the chemical state, the milieu, et cetera. Being able to discriminate between biologically meaningful effects and biologically irrelevant effects had to be worked through. It didn't surprise me that those who have to ultimately give the seal of approval had to figure a lot of this out. Plus, if you go back 20 years, we still didn't even know which cells we were going to use for these products. What we tried to do at our company, Cellularity, and ultimately in the next generations of these corporate efforts, is to first and foremost come up with a reliable platform of cellular source material that could meet this need in the industry. Show that we can manufacture products to scale, quality, and consistency that was going to fit the healthcare system. Identify the clinically meaningful effect in a disease. Show that it's better than the alternatives and then submit the data to get approvals. That's kind of the process you've got to take. Why aren't these products available to make us look 25 right now? It's because the current standard by which we get these products approved are first to show that they're useful in unmet medical needs. Reading through this, are you saying that you really have the faith that once we're able to get it through the system, it really is going to be that impactful? Or do you think we're at the beginning of a longer journey where we have to figure out, okay, you give them the stem cell, but then you hit them with this other thing and then this other thing. Those three things together have the massive effect. I think we're approaching a threshold, a watershed event where approval, FDA and other regulatory approval of cellular medicines in a discrete clinical area. I think that the first area is going to be a limited condition where there aren't a lot of good alternatives because that's where the regulatory community is most willing to be most risk tolerant, if you will. When that happens and we begin to expand the safety database around those products, you're going to see an explosion in the number of additional approvals that will occur. What's really encouraging to me is I think we're really close to that happening. The first approval of a cell therapy product in a really nasty disease like a cancer or an autoimmune disease that destroys people's lives, following those approvals, you will see these products rapidly taken up and employed in much more mainstream illnesses. Do you have to be careful how you answer this question because you're in a public company? Because I want to know, the guy that gave himself H. pylori and then gave himself the antibiotic solution, I want to know the answers to those questions. Do you know Ben Greenfield? Yes, sure. That motherfucker injected stem cells everywhere, in his face, in his dick, literally everything. He was even saying he thought it gave him an extra quarter inch, if I remember. I was like, what? People are going to abuse this Ben Greenfield. Yes, I understand you have to be very thoughtful and careful about how you answer that. I'm very eager to probe off camera perhaps. This is fascinating. It's going somewhere very interesting. What do we have right now today? We're using Tony's story as an example. If we're really committed, we follow through with the therapy, what kind of benefits right now today with what's approved can we get? You're asking a really interesting, challenging, and treacherous question. It's my favorite kind of question. You're so good at it, Tom. The truth of the matter is we are going to first move approvals for cellular medicines in the worst diseases where we don't have really good therapeutic alternatives. When we prove the utility there- Are you guys going for COVID? We've actually pursued the treatment of various cancers. What about work in the cell? That's where cellular medicine has evolved. We went from originally wanting to put stem cells as the primary product into different conditions like autoimmune diseases to now saying, well, if the stem cell can give rise to an immune cell that has biological activity like a natural killer cell that can be used to fight cancer, help treat viral infections. Are you training the stem cell before injecting it in? You're a killer cell now. Go. That's a good way of looking at it. Instead of using the word training, what I would say is we're specializing from a stem cell, a discrete population of cells we know the activity of. Natural killer cells, which are a- How do you do that? Do you have to give it an instruction? It has those instructions already pre-programmed. All you have to do is lead it down the path. How do you do that? Literally, no analogy, how do you do that? You do it with a cocktail of factors which under normal circumstances drive the specialization of your stem cells in your body to become a red blood cell, or become a white blood cell, or become a hair cell. We understand what those signals are. That's fucking crazy. You may not understand this, but this is really interesting. This is bananas. It is. I love this shit. We are at the, we're beginning to live in the future. It feels like that. And Tom, listen, I've devoted the last 25 years of my life to this. It's what I get up every day to pursue because I do believe like you that we are on the threshold of cellular medicine becoming the most logical, the most deployable, the most impactful way of treating disease because it's the way nature treats disease. We know, I often used to say that stem cells are nature's first aid kit. When you have an injury or a disease, your body is signaling the compartments in your body that house these stem cells to send them to me. By the way, I'll tell you something fascinating you're going to love. Do you know that a pregnant woman who is injured, for example, a pregnant woman in a car accident where even the fetus might have some degree of injury, do you know that there's evidence that stem cells from the placenta actually traffic into the mother and find their way into her injuries? Impact Theory University, one full year for only $997. And if you act now, you get to join my exclusive live 90-minute workshop called Make Any Goals Stick. The great news is I don't care if you were the highest achiever in the world in 2022 or if 2022 beat you down hard. 22 has been a brutal year for a lot of people. And that's why I'm going to be going live later this month to host a workshop on exactly what you need to do if you want to make any goal stick. Do not miss it. Dude, that's how I know that a fetus is basically a parasite. And it's like, no, no, no, I can't have you dying on me because I need to exist. So I'm going to give you a little something something to get you back in business. That's crazy. And I know the punchline about cancer as well, that women can go into remission when they're pregnant. That's insane. So sorry, I derailed this again. So we- But I love what you did. But you used the term parasite. They're actually a saprophyte. They actually- A saprophyte? It's another term. So a parasite would be if all the benefit was unidirectional. Yeah. Right? Yeah, fair. They actually benefit each other. Fair. And you mentioned something which was one of the hallmarks of our work in autoimmune disease. We recognized early on that certain women with autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and so on, would experience profound improvement in their symptoms during pregnancy. And what's the reason? Some guys said, well, it's hormonal, but when you use hormones, it doesn't work. And some guys said, well, you know what? Maybe the same cells which are making the mother accept the placenta. So let's admit, may I tease this out a bit? Yeah, please. You know, a placenta is produced with the fetus from the fertilized egg and sperm. It is a unique individual with its unique genomic and genotype, right? Which means the mother that carries it is not a perfect match for it. And should reject it. Should reject it, but she doesn't. She carries it for nine months without any immune conflict that would terminate the pregnancy or damage her health, right? Those carrying the placenta and fetus aren't more subject to infectious diseases, things like that. Well, consider this. In surrogate pregnancy, the mother's not even related to the fetus. She's in the chills. It's crazy. She's not even... That is more like a true parasite. But the fetus coexists in the maternal system without that immunologic conflict. Now, we said, well, can we use that to our advantage? So since we saw... Fast, I want to give people one anchor. So one of the things with MS, you get lesions in your brain. You've seen lesions be eradicated. That's crazy. With that in mind of how dramatic, please continue. And the best evidence of that was a report in the New England Journal of Medicine probably 10 years ago. The study followed 300 women with multiple sclerosis who were pregnant. And they found enormously high percentage. I think it was 80% of the women went into profound states of remission where, just like you said, the lesions in their brains improved, their symptoms improved. In fact, many women came out of pregnancy and they relapsed and they said, you know what? I got to get pregnant again. Yeah. Dude, I literally was thinking the same thing. I'd stay pregnant forever. Yeah. So on the basis of that, we theorize, is it possible that the same cells from the placenta that permit cohabitation in a surrogate mom, if we productize those and use those as a therapeutic, could we induce a state of remission? And in fact, we saw that. In fact, when we use placental cells, these are just pluripotent stem cells. These are versatile stem cells from the placenta. From any donor? From any donor. This is bananas. Because remember, placenta is a one-size-fits-all cell. If you take those cells and put them into a patient with an autoimmune disease like Crohn's disease, we saw evidence of really significant improvements in the patient's disease. Don't stem cells have DNA? They must. They do. They do. So how on earth can they be a universal donor? Because it should be like, a male cell is telling you to be male, a female cell is telling you to be female. Like, if I inject you with stem cells, does your hair color change? Like, what? I don't understand that. So it just turns out that the cells from the placenta, because of evolution's brilliance, have the ability to turn off any immune response against them and induce a state of tolerance. Do they stay around, though? They do. How are they split? How are they not, like, if I gave my wife stem cells, how does she not start getting my cells populating in her brain, her liver, her kidney? And if they did, you gotta think about the stoichiometry of this, okay? If you're 25 trillion cells and you get a million cells from your wife, think of the, or vice versa, think of the tiny contribution of those cells to your overall biology and genome, right? In other words, it's not like you're replacing your entire body with these new cells, you're just supplementing your body with these new cells. Do you have to keep topping them up, then? I love it, Tom. This is exactly what I believe may, in fact, be a method or a strategy to help improve our health and biology during our lifetimes by simply giving us the benefit of an added set of instructions, okay? So think about this for a second. You know what the term chimera means? Yes. So, you can actually create chimerism in an individual by delivering cells from a donor, an unrelated donor, and those cells take up residence in you for a period of time. You now carry two sets of instructions, right? Yeah. And by the way, we know from our friends in the microbiome world, you carry lots of instructions, not even human instructions. But these additional instructions that you carry in the cells that maybe make up one millionth of a percent of your total cell volume, they still respond to the same signals and factors in your body that you're exposed to. So let's say you've got a susceptibility to develop... Let me give you an actual example. HIV, the causative agent behind immunodeficiency of AIDS, occurs because the virus gains access to the cells by docking to a molecule on your white blood cells, your lymphocytes, called CCR5. Now, CCR5 is a molecule that in a percentage of the population just isn't expressed. They are natural, what we call CCR5 knockouts. And interestingly, about 4% of the human population in the United States is naturally CCR5 negative. If you inject HIV into them, they do not get AIDS. What? Yes. Now, by the way, roughly 10% of the population in Europe is thought to be CCR5 negative because bubonic plague selected for them. That is so interesting. Isn't that cool? So listen to this. If I can't get infected with HIV because of my cells not expressing that molecule, but I take some of my stem cells and put them in a patient who is HIV positive, who actually has CCR5 and has been infected and has developed the disease, we actually now know you can actually convert them to HIV negative. Holy shit. You can take somebody 100% HIV negative? Yeah. Yeah. And it's now being published. How is HIV not eradicated then? So all HIV does is it damages the integrity and the functionality of your immune system, right? That's why you get opportunistic infections and so on and so forth. If I now give you cells that create your immune integrity, but resistant to HIV, you now can combat and battle HIV, and in fact, some of those cells will actually go and kill off the HIV infected cells. So this is now being done and published on, and some of the pioneering work, in fact, at my alma mater, Cornell, they actually showed the ability to convert an HIV patient from positive to negative doing this. I thought I heard a headline like that, but I never ... Do you think that'll become standard of care over some period of time? It's my dream. So in fact, many, many years ago, almost 20 years ago, I had a concept that I wanted to explore. One of the motivations for creating cellularity was to look at the possibility that I could induce a state of super health by simply giving you more than one copy of DNA, different copy of DNA, and allow natural selection to upregulate those things that give you a health advantage. So you know what hybrid vigor is? Hybrid vigor is mom and dad have two separate genetic makeups. The more distant they are from one another, when they recombine, the offspring has certain biological advantages. That's hybrid vigor. It's why every generation health improves. It's why sexual reproduction is the thing. Exactly. Now, a hybrid vigor occurs between generations, right? If I gave you ... Oh my God, I know where you're going. If I gave you a dose of stem cells that had a completely new complement of DNA ... Is this being tested? So finish the sentence, yeah, this is insane. So my concept was, can I create chimeric vigor? Can I create a stable chimera that gave you the advantages of all the DNA in the world that was disease resistant, and let nature, let natural selection, let's put Darwin in the driver's seat, and let natural selection upregulate those things that give you the highest quality of health? So the theory of chimeric vigor is simply this. You have 23, 24,000 genes in your body that you're born with. What if I gave you access to 10 different times the number of alleles at those different genes so that you could have the advantages that every individual has, but you can't package in one individual? And so here's something that's really interesting. I believe, and it's one of the theories that I, again, based my work on, that chimerism is in fact biologically sound. Chimerism occurs in, for example, in animals that create litters, like dogs that have five or six puppies in a litter. Each one of those puppies is a unique genome, but they are exchanging cells with each other, and some of those cells will take up residence in the animal for their lifetime. So the animals become chimeras of one another, and as chimeras of one another, they have the advantage of more than one form of a gene to call upon in order to advance their health. And by the way, natural selection will always up-regulate the trait that gives you a survival advantage. Dude, that's bananas. Is that being tested now? It's one of the things we're very excited about testing, and again, it goes back to why over 25 years we've built one of the largest libraries of newborn cells that are cryopreserved so that I can interrogate the genome of all of those donors. And eventually, I'm working with some absolute rock stars in the field. One of my dear friends and one of the smartest people I've ever met, Jack Hittery, has a new company called SandboxAQ. Sandbox is a quantum computing, artificial intelligence, expert, expert company. And we've been talking for some time about using that type of technology to interrogate the library of donors, interrogate their genetics, and then use machine learning to pull out which donors give me the best traits to convert to this patient. And if I can give those to a patient who might have an underlying genetic predisposition to a disease, can I counteract that? And so that's where I think the future of cellular medicine is. The future is coming up with the right mix of donors that allow Darwin natural selection, Darwinian natural selection, to select for those traits that maximize and optimize your health and disease resistance. And it's one of the things that turns me on. I mean, this is what gets me excited. Jesus. Yeah. That's very interesting. So go back to COVID for a second. So let me get you, so I know where you're going. Let me preempt you. We talked before about the fact that from any stem cell in the placenta, I can produce any mature phenotype, any mature cell type, a brain cell, a heart cell, an immune cell. Now we recognize another observation we made. We talked about the observation of placentas being one size fits all, universal donor cells and all that. The other observation we made was that one out of every thousand pregnant women has some form of cancer during pregnancy. But the transmission of cancer from a mother to a developing fetus essentially is non-existent. It's so rare that the few reports of it haven't even created a causal relationship. So the theory was that something is protecting, something was selected for in nature to protect the developing fetus from a threat like a transferred disease from the mother, like a transferred cancer from the mother. Now, we went looking what could possibly be behind that. And we found that the placenta has a population of immune cells called placental natural killer cells that are part of the innate immune system, which means that they don't have to be educated. They come out, they come out punching. They're already primed to protect the developing fetus. And if you think about it, right, a human being devotes nine months of reproductive energy to one offspring. Natural selection is going to do everything to keep that offspring viable to get to full term. So to protect against cancer transmission threat, to protect against infectious disease threat, we theorized that this natural killer cell played a role. Because remember, when a baby is born, they're born with their innate immune system and a limited adaptive immune system because they haven't been exposed to anything yet. In the window after birth, what's protecting that newborn from an infectious death? So we started to test this hypothesis and found that the natural killer cell is pre-programmed to traffic to and destroy cells that express certain markers on their surface called stress antigens. A stress antigen is a flag. It's a flag the cell waves to say, hey, something's not good here. Kill me. All right? So it turns out that stress antigens expressed on cancer cells, virally infected cells, and this is exciting, senescent cells, the same stress antigens make them the target for these NK cells. So think of the NK cell as the cleanup cell. It's the seek and destroy cell that goes out, kills stress antigen expressing cancer cells, stress antigen expressing infected cells, stress antigen infecting old senescent cells. Now, we tested this hypothesis and it works. And so we currently are using placental natural killer cells to treat cancer. We've used them to treat viral infections like COVID. And we're using them to treat age-related degenerative cells, senescent cells as well. So we believe that the placenta is the best source of immune cells that clean up bad stuff, help create an environment that promotes survival of the healthy cells, and is renewable, can be redosed, reutilized as you live your life because the threats you are exposed to when you're alive differ. It's COVID today. What's it going to be 10 years from now? So that same mechanism that protects you today, we believe will be therapeutically useful to protect you in the future. Whoa. Okay. So we are, we're able to train the stem cell. Nope, you didn't want me to use the word train. We are able to create the milieu so that it becomes the cell that we want it to become. Can we turn one into one of these killer cells? Absolutely. Or do those have to come from the placenta? Or we now know what the chemical signals are to get it to become, what'd you call it, an HK? NK. NK. So I can convince, I'll use the word convince, I can convince a stem cell from the placenta to mature and specialize into virtually any phenotype mature cell we know of in order to get them to become natural killer cells. We get to a state where we have the hematopoietic progenitor stem cell. That's the stem cell that matures from the original stem cell but specializes to become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. And when I get it to the point of making a white blood cell, I simply nudge it to become a natural killer cell. Now I can mass produce those natural killer cells and I can administer them to you as a therapeutic as a one-size-fits-all therapeutic product. So if you think about it, for a cell therapy product to be meaningful, you gotta make it. You gotta make it with such quality that it meets a high standard like a pharmaceutical. You gotta make sure that you can administer it safely and you gotta be able to do this without breaking the bank. So there's no better place to find cells to do all this than the placenta. There's no better place. This is a raw material. This is, in my opinion, the most valuable biologic raw material we know of. And we've been working on this for 25 years. We built all the systems. We've procured cells and biomaterials from approaching 100,000 newborn donors in our history. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. So here you've got a natural resource. I call it nature's crude oil. And all we had to do was develop a refinery system. And by the way, aside from the cells we get from the placenta, we also harvest the structural biomaterials from the placenta and we turn those into products. What does that do? So I think you may have seen, I may have shown you, from the placenta we take the membranes which create the amniotic sac and those membranes can be processed to remove the cells but leave behind the three-dimensional architecture. I can then dehydrate it and sterilize it and put it on the shelf. And if a surgeon needs to replace a tissue and create a tissue repair template, they can use that product right off the shelf. I can take the structural materials and break them down into the component structural elements that are a couple of microns in size. And I can administer those to boost or augment your structure in order to allow the repair process to occur. So let's look at a thing like a wound or a non-healing fracture. In the defect of the wound or the non-healing fracture, I have cells that are dividing but they need to stick to something. If I can give them something to stick to, what we call a template, a repair template, you actually can support the functional restoration of that tissue. And I could show you examples in burn patients. I could show you examples in patients with non-healing diabetic ulcers. I can show you examples in patients with defects from traumatic injuries where just the introduction of the structural material supports repair. Now think about if I use that plus the cells, how much you are basically mimicking nature's attempt to, and you're augmenting nature's process of repair. And that's what cellularity and our technology is focused on, providing these very, very biologically logical tools to augment repair, regeneration, and restoration of function. What's the state of the art with burns? I heard about the skin gun like six years ago. Is that real? Absolutely. So Steve Badalack at Pittsburgh, one of my heroes, brilliant, brilliant. By the way, I think he's an MD, DVM, PhD. He's got lots of credentials, lots of initials. He's got the longest business card in biotech. Steve showed that you can spray some of these structural elements onto a defect, and they will again set up a repair template, encourage the arrival and attachment of cells, and then the cells will start the process of rebuilding that tissue. It makes a lot of sense. You know, again, as an engineer, every structure in our body, every piece of our anatomy is a combination of structure and cells. It's like if you build a house, what do you put up first? The frame, right? The frame then supports the attachment of the matrix components, the cells that ultimately create the living tissue, the functional tissue. So if your problem after a burn or after an injury is you're making cells, but you're not making matrix, then where do the cells stick to? And so I often described it this way. At the heart of a wound, a non-healing wound, you have a tremendous stimulus for cell division at the margins, right? At the margins of the open wound, the cells say, hey, wait a second, this isn't a closed tissue. I need to make more cells to close the gap. When they make more cells, but there's no matrix there, the cells just get dumped into the void and they become what's called exudate. And exudate is that liquidy kind of material, that pussy sort of material that basically washes away over time and the defect doesn't close. But if I put a template in there, if I put this structural material in there and the cells can attach to that structure, they're happy, they start to divide, and when they get close enough, you know what the cells do? They form what are called tight junctional complexes. The cells at connection points anchor to one another, and when they anchor to one another, they can actually contract and pull the wound closed. That's how wounds heal. So all we're doing by taking these materials out of the left of our placenta is we're providing an alternative to nature's attempt to close these defects by supporting it with a supplement. And the supplement is in the form of a structural material and or the cells. Are we at the point now where we could, if somebody had a scar, we could go in, sort of create the wound again and lay the structural material down and eliminate the scar or are we still a ways away from that? So we're absolutely at this point. In fact, scar revision surgery, when someone has an injury or a wound and it doesn't heal and they get these nasty hypertrophic scars that look terrible, what surgeons do is they cut that scar out as cleanly as possible, doing as little damage to the underlying tissue as possible, and they hope that they can restore continuity and minimize the secondary, the next scar. Well, the best way to do this is to introduce components that the body would have to synthesize on its own in order to shorten the time for that process to occur. And so we already know that these biomaterial products can help and we are certain that the cellular products, even the byproducts of these cells, can help support and encourage and augment and accelerate that repair process. That's crazy. So you kind of melted my brain a little bit with the chimera idea and being able to make somebody's, I don't know if it's only the immune system or if it's anything, but to make them more robust by introducing the new cell types. And then also I want to go back to, you've got the stress flag that the cells are waving. How advanced is that process? Because theoretically, if you can swap out all of your senescent cells, that really would be where you're aging literally backwards. And so is there a tolerance? Is there a point at which it's too many cells? Going back to Lisa and I, so if you take my stem cells and you're putting them in her, you were saying, well, if she's 20 trillion cells or whatever, and you inject 1 million, it's not a big deal. But what if it's 10 trillion? Is there a point at which it becomes an issue or no, we can just, the more the merrier? We're still working on the calculus of cell therapy. We know, for example, in immunotherapy for cancer where we're introducing an immune cell, that there's clearly a calculus. You need so many immune cells to defeat so many cancer cells. There's no doubt about that. In regenerative applications, regenerative medicine, we're going to figure that out too. But remember, if the cells I deliver to you in a million cell dose take up residence in your body and they themselves propagate and expand, maybe that million cells over the course of six months to a year turns out to be a billion cells. So the contribution to your overall biology will actually be enhanced. Now consider this for a second. The process of aging, okay, which there's lots of theories behind it and so on, and we don't yet have great tools to figure out what your real biologic age is. I've been convinced- What do you think about the Horvath clock? I think that these clocks are really important. In fact, I was with Morgan Levine from all those laboratories maybe a week or two ago talking about this. There's no doubt in my mind that epigenetic changes that are accumulated in your lifetime can be thought of as a metric for the biological age of that cell. Now we still don't fully understand how much DNA methylation is too much. But here's the bottom line. The closer you get to a newborn source of cells, the lower the amount of methylation that exists on the DNA. So if I introduce that cell into an individual, by definition I've put a younger cell into an older system. Now hear me out for a minute. If you say that we are the summation, we are the sigma of all of the ages of the cells in our body, by the time we reach 40, 50, 60 years of age, the vast majority of our cells are going to have advanced biological age. If I want to change that, I either have to pull out the really old cells or I have to introduce younger cells that change the sigma. If the average is a function of the age of 5 billion cells out of 5 trillion cells, do the math. You can figure out how much you can affect your overall biological age by looking at that calculus. But consider also that we're at a point now where you have to look not just at the DNA methylation as a marker of the age of the cell, but you've got to look at things like telomere length. Telomeres, often at one time thought of as being a potential biological clock, telomeres which protect the ends of our chromatin and are exhausted after repeated cell division because you literally degrade the telomere as you divide. The other thing to keep in mind is that your mitochondria age as well. So any cell coming from an older donor, older source, that has short telomeres, older mitochondria and lots of DNA methylation, by definition, ain't going to make you younger. But a cell from a newborn with long telomeres, with very, very little, if any, DNA methylation and really young mitochondria, that's what I want to put into my tank. So stem cells, if I were to take my own skin cell or whatever, spin it into a stem cell and re-inject it, those are going to be aged cells? Yes. Okay, so they're still going to carry some of the methylation, the short telomeres. That's right. I always wondered about that. So that's a really good point because the world has made great advances in induced pluripotent stem cells. What that means is, and Yamanaka, who won the Nobel Prize, showed that you can take a mature cell and you can coax it into becoming more stem-like with a series of factors, a cocktail we call it. The reason for inducing pluripotency is because most adults don't have their own cells stored away from birth, right? The problem is that everything that's done to induce pluripotency in a mature cell is already resident in a cell found in a newborn. And so although I might be able to coax this cell into behaving like a stem cell, it doesn't necessarily have the biologic quality of a newborn stem cell. So if you think about this, how do we get to that mature cell, that mature specialized cell? We get there by a series of cell divisions and cell differentiations. When a cell goes from a stem cell to a mature cholinergic neuron, a specialized brain cell, every time it divides and specializes, those specializations are a series of gene silencing events. So if you think about it, you have all this chromatin in a stem cell, but if I want to become a cholinergic neuron, I don't need 40, 50 percent of the genes to be expressed. And so what nature does in order to create a more efficient terminal phenotype is it silences those genes. It literally takes the chromatin and kind of crumbles it up and keeps it out of access to these transcription factors. By doing that, you've created a cell that's very efficient at being a neuron but not versatile. So Yamanaka's work showed that you can take that cell and you can coax it back in to behaving like a stem cell, but you don't necessarily make it a younger cell. So there's two different things, right? There's stemness and then there's young versus old. So if you take placental stem cells, you can make them replicate? Oh, yeah. And they will stay young forever? No, no. Or even they as they age? They'll age too. But if I have a supply of the young ones, if I have a supply of these ones which are young and uncorrupted, and I just keep introducing them into the system, what effect will that have? So you and I talked about this, I think, when we were sitting around. It turns out that maybe 15 years ago, the theory that we age because we use up our stem cells drove me to a set of experiments where I collected the stem cells from the placenta of newborn rats, and I processed them just the same way we did with our human cells, and I cryopreserved them. I put them in a state of suspended animation, which means that they're going to be the same 10 years later than they are today when I thaw them. When I took those cells and gave them back to the animals as they were aging. Their own cells? Their own cells. When I gave them back as they were aging, the animals that got their cells back lived 40% longer than their litter mates. And they were bigger and stronger and meaner. That to me said, hey, one of the most obvious places to look here is can we create a biological state with enhanced youthfulness by simply averaging down the age by introducing these young cells into an aging subject? Is it a more potent effect if they were your stem cells? Right now, I don't think so. Because again, the placental cells are the universal donor. I think there are advantages to giving someone else's placental cells because you get that chimeric benefit. Okay, so huge impact in rats. Are we running any long tail studies on aging life extension and stem cells? So here's the dilemma we have. To the regulatory community and to a good part of the clinical community, aging isn't a disease, right? Aging is a process. And so it's very difficult to convince that community in all cases that an attempt to address aging as the indication, it ain't the way to go. Because first of all, how long would the study have to be in humans? You know, decades? You know, how are you going to show that you can slow aging? Are you going to start treating at 20 and look at them when they're 80? It's kind of tough, right? It's long. For sure. But that's what we care about. But no one's going to invest in that. Fair. Okay, but. Very fair. Our approach is to say, well, let's look at conditions that are a hallmark of aging. One of those conditions you and I know about very well, sarcopenia. Age-related loss of muscle mass, sarcopenia, is in fact a hallmark of age-related degenerative processes. If you say that, and you remember from our days developing strategies to block things like myostatin, that if you can, in essence, have a known rate of decline in an organ or tissue and in muscle, we estimate that after the age of about 25, average people lose one to two percent of their lean muscle mass every year. And by the way, you've helped provide tools to address one of the reasons why we lose muscle, which is a protein defect. If you now say, okay, I'm going to administer something which is going to block or reverse the loss of lean muscle mass and maintain the integrity, quantity, and quality of muscle tissue into our advanced years, is that a tool we'd use to address aging? And I argue that, yeah, it would be. And so we're deeply committed to exploring how placental newborn-derived stem cells administered to support the integrity and the health of our muscle tissue might be one of the most actionable ways to address aging. And let me give you one clinical reason why I believe that. The Karolinska Institute, which is like the Mayo Clinic of Europe, they did a study where they followed 9,000 men for 25 years, like a Framingham-type study. And they were looking to see whether they could correlate body mass index, BMI, to risk of death from cancer, risk of all death, risk of death from cardiovascular disease. And everyone assumed that, of course, BMI is going to definitely have a relationship. What they found was that BMI wasn't correlated. What was correlated to resistance to death from cancer and heart disease was muscle mass. That's why BMI is dumb. BMI is very dumb. Because it doesn't differentiate between fat and muscle. The average bodybuilder, extreme athlete you find at the gym is morbidly obese by those scales. Right? The truth of the matter is that BMI ain't related to your risk profile for certain things. But if you maintain your muscle mass and strength into your advanced years, 70s and 80s, the report showed you had a lower risk of dying from cancer by 30 to 40 percent. Impacts cancer? Yeah. I'm really scandalized by that. But let me tell you why. Please. Let me tell you why. Your muscle mass makes up, in the average individual, 50 percent of your wet body mass. Yeah. Which means it's the largest venous capacitance organ in your body. You have more volume of venous blood in your muscle tissue than anywhere else. Right? It's just a lot of tissue and a lot of blood vessels. In your low pressure venous system is where the blood cells, the immune cells and the stem cells that are traversing your system, they stick to the walls. They stick to the walls of those little low pressure blood vessels. Why do they do that? Because they're sitting there waiting for signals to traffic into the system. What's one of the best things you can do in response to injury or illness? Exercise. Exercise helps mobilize those immune and stem cells. If I have the flu, I should work out? Absolutely. What? Absolutely. Okay. A hundred years of bed rest after MI and after surgery? Why do you think we get patients up walking hours after their surgery? Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. We have a Billy family rule. If you're sick, you need to take the time off from the gym because you're going to wear yourself out. You're going to decline your immune system. You're going to stay sick longer. I could pass a lie detector that that is 100 percent guaranteed true fact and you're telling me that it's delusion on my part. In your household, that may be one of the tenants, but I would say you need to test the opposite, which is that if you actually exercise and if you actually- Aren't you just running yourself down? No. Because look, if this works, the next time I'm sick, I'm fucking hitting the gym. You have to. You have to. Weird. In fact- Is this going to shorten the amount of time that I'm sick? Absolutely. Because- I'll do anything to shorten the amount of time I'm sick. Remember, the immune cells that are going to protect you from that infectious illness, if some of them are sitting laying in wait in your muscle tissue- But isn't there such a thing as fatigue? You're just wearing yourself out. But the reason you feel fatigued is that your immune system needs reinforcements to combat the illness. Like with COVID, for example. Some of the problems with COVID is that you have residual effects of a highly stimulated immune system localized that needs support. It's very, very clear that even things like massage help mobilize immune cells and stem cells that take up residence in your muscle tissue. So next time you're sick, give me a call, but I'm going to insist you go to the gym and work out. Work into a big sweat and I guarantee you, I guarantee you, you will feel differently than you expect it to feel. Man, that is one thing. Lisa and I have talked a lot about that because she is a workout demon. And she, no matter what, sick, whatever, she wants to be in the gym. And I'm always like, you are going to make yourself sick for longer. You're wearing yourself out, you're taking your immune system down. That's crazy. Well, don't take it just from me. I want you to talk to any cardiac surgeon you know, any surgeon that you know. And you ask them, when you guys started 20, 30, 40 years ago, didn't you keep patients in bed after surgery? How come now you get them up walking immediately? How come you increase? How immediately are we talking? Oh, cardiac surgeries, patients will be walking the night of their surgery. Whoa. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Wow. So there's, by the way, and they do it for lots of reasons. They do it in order to prevent stagnation of your circulating blood. They want to make sure that you're not developing clots in your small blood vessels and so on. But there's another big component of it, which is that active muscle, active muscle actually helps your immune function and helps initiate the process of repair and recovery. All right. If I'm injecting stem cells in the way that you're talking about to fight the loss of muscle mass, am I going to just not lose the muscle mass or does this have an androgenic effect? Like if I am taking stem cells, obviously I still have to work out, but if I'm taking stem cells, would I add more muscle mass than I otherwise would? We have data from some of our clinical studies, not in muscle loss, in other diseases, where the injection of these stem cells into muscle tissue encouraged both improved circulation in the muscle, actually allowed us, we saw that collateral circulation was improving, and we saw improvements in muscle mass and function. Now, we are studying now, we have a current IND, an investigational new drug application on file to look at forms of muscle loss associated with inherited diseases and ultimately acquired diseases. I am extremely convinced that we will show that you can, in fact, augment and increase the quality and I believe the quantity of muscle tissue with the introduction of these stem cells into your muscle as a therapeutic. All right. That definitely starts to get interesting, especially with the correlation. I had never heard that muscle mass is inversely correlated to incidence of cancer. That is really intriguing. Talk to me about genomics, like what is the role of our genes play in this? Is this going to be able to combat that kind of thing or they're just totally unrelated? No, listen, everything draws back to your underlying biological software and what that encodes for everything from the health and integrity of your stem cell population to how those stem cells function. There's no doubt about that. However, we already know that you may be born with a certain genome. That genome may, in fact, be affected by, we talked about before, epigenetic changes and so on, but consider that if you can actually boost or augment your genomic capabilities with chimeric therapy or the introduction of a therapeutic product that even exists transiently in your body, like a cell therapy, that the more genetic alleles you have access to select from, the more likely you are to accommodate for any disease or illness. Once again, that's the process of natural selection. Biology is driven towards whatever allows survival. It's one of the reasons why even viruses, which are not living, need a host and if the host isn't viable, the virus goes away. Viruses that kill too fast don't stay in the environment too long. So it's a complicated dance between the programming in your genes, the quality of the stem cells in your body, and the diseases and the threats they have to address. If that balance is always shifted towards giving you the greatest optionality, genetic optionality, cellular optionality, you have the greatest probability of being able to survive. What do you think about fat in all of that? So obviously keeping muscle mass high, critically important, but fat as an organ that secretes hormones, what is that role? I do worry about that in terms of you can have all the muscle in the world, but if you also have a ton of fat, you're going to be creating problems for yourself. The reality is that the experts in metabolism will tell you that you need a certain degree of fat for normal biologic and anatomic functions. Fat plays a lot more of a role than just storing energy. Fat also plays a role in cushioning your organs and your tissues. In other words, believe it or not, you have fat around your organs and tissues that are there to provide shock suppression. There's different types of fat that when stored, it's harder to mobilize them in order to create energy and in some cases that fat can actually wind up having negative impacts on your anatomy and so on. However, when you are operating at a maximum optimal lean muscle mass, I guarantee you you'll have the best balance to your fat stores because that muscle mass helps control the level of fat that you develop. You've heard about the, what do they call it? They call it the skinny fat. People who appear to be thin and in shape, if you actually look at them, if you actually dissect them, you realize that they have very little muscle mass and it's been replaced by fatty tissue. That's actually age-related sarcopenia. There is a balance there that can be optimized if you focus on optimizing one system, which is the lean muscle mass. Very interesting. So you have less concern, I'm putting words in your mouth so correct me if I'm wrong, but you have less concern about somebody carrying too much fat if they've got the muscle to back it up and in fact there is such a thing as too little fat. Absolutely. I mean we know that from the population of cachectic and anorexic patients, right? Well, so put the muscle back on the anorexic patient or a bodybuilder for that matter. They're getting down to 2%, 3% fat. Are they, I doubt this has been studied, but are there, if you've got a gaggle of muscle mass but very little fat, does your survivability start to go down? So I don't want to make any statements about how long can you be in the true bodybuilder phenotype in your lifetime and still be healthy. I can't answer that, but I don't believe personally that the true competitive bodybuilder phenotype is a form that you can sustain your entire lifetime. Remember Jack LaLanne? Of course. Jack LaLanne was an incredibly fit guy. He wasn't 2% body fat, right? He was more like the norm. I think that the quest to reduce body fat for the aesthetic purposes, okay, in temporary or transient use supports the objectives of that particular individual, but over a long sustained period of time I think it's dangerous. All right, obviously you co-authored the amazing book Life Force. Where else can people find you? So a couple of things. So I'm really excited. One of my important partners in this whole quest is DLP, a company that not only has deep interest in their business but also in advancing the state of health around the world. So we're very excited about the success of the book, but we're also very excited about working with one of our partners, DLP Capital, which is not only supportive of their business but also using their business to help advance progress in our field. I'm very, very excited to be one of the speakers at their event in Puerto Rico in San Juan, the 9th to the 12th of November. For those folks who want to actually come and hear me, meet me, speak with me, or talk to other of my colleagues, we'd love them to go to dlpcapital.com. Under events they can actually register for this program and they can join us. I can tell you, having been at several of these, it's one remarkable assembly of investors, health conscious people, scientists, physicians, and I'm excited about being able to talk about what you and I have been talking about as well as some additional things we're doing at Cellularity and at Fountain Life, which as you know is our clinic operations. I love it. Yeah. Guys, if you haven't already, be sure to subscribe and until next time, my friends, be legendary. Take care. Peace.

    "In the Impact Theory episode featuring Ray Dalio, a renowned billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, a wide range of topics is explored, with a central focus on the global economic landscape and the challenges it currently faces. The conversation between Tom Bilyeu and Ray Dalio delves into various aspects of economics, geopolitics, and the dynamics that shape our world today.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary concerns highlighted in the discussion is the vulnerability of the U.S. dollar. Ray Dalio expresses his unease regarding the ongoing international efforts by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to reduce their reliance on the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. He emphasizes that this shift is not an outright attack on the dollar but rather a reflection of the changing economic landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dalio draws parallels between historical events where other reserve currencies, such as the British pound and the Dutch guilder, lost their dominance due to a combination of factors, including holding excessive amounts of the currency and concerns over potential sanctions. He explains that countries are now looking for alternatives to transact in, driven by a desire to avoid the risks associated with holding large amounts of dollar-denominated debt and the potential for sanctions.\n",
