(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\n platform  (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d  or  \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).  We  connect  consumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  forridesharing\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (\u201cEater(s)\u201d)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with  deliveryservice\n providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  \u201cend-user(s)\u201d  or\u201cconsumer(s).\u201d\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\nagmented markets.Mobility\nMobility\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\nOur\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform.",
        "f6012f4f-d5ff-4082-a85e-e703b700e849": "In addition to b\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\nDuring\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup,\n Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly\u2019s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. Theacquisition\n of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item8, \u201cFinancial Statements \nand Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Freight\nWe believe that Freigh\nt is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries\n to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis\n highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of theprocess\n conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally\n difficult  for carriers  to find and book the shipments  that work for their businesses,  spending hours on the phone negotiating  pricing  and terms.  Theseinefficiencies adv\nersely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,4",
        "2a00009c-fc53-47af-b68b-9c498a001e59": "which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automateand\n accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricingand the ability to book a shipm\nent with the touch of a button.We\n serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,secure\n capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors representsignificant efficiency improvement\ns over traditional freight brokerage providers.During\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight businessthrough\n Transplace\u2019s  expertise  in transportation  management.  The acquisition  of Transplace  has been accounted  for as a business combination.  For additionalinformation, see Note\n 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlatform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe\n foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it ex\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.\nWe intend to continue to inv\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\n users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery\n attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.\n Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\n compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these t\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-pl\natform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice,\n and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities\n as a subscription offering.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive Environment\nWe\n compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe\n logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants \ngiven the low barriers to entry that characterize5",
        "2156bf58-c36f-46bb-a3f0-516ba4a37d5c": "these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition. While\n we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do. The competition we fa\nce in each of our offerings includes:\u2022\nMobility.  Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat\n we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,public\n transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We\n also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint ventu\nre.\u2022\nDelivery.  Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and\n merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. OurDelivery offering also c\nompetes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022\nFreight.  Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate\n in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and\n regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments,\n labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly\n evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are des\ncribed below.Mobility\nOur\n platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions\n in  which  we  operate.  A large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in fo\nreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In\n the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including\n licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and\n regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including\n Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations\n banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexi\nties for our business and operating model.Substantially\n all states in the United States and numerous municipalities  in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation NetworkCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These r\negulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their ownvehicles\n to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations."
